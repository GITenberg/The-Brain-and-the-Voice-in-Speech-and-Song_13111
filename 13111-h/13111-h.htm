<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The contents of this little book formed the subject of three
lectures delivered at the Royal Institution "On the Mechanism of
the Human Voice" and three London University lectures at King's
College on "The Brain in relation to Speech and Song." I have
endeavoured to place this subject before my readers in as simple
language as scientific accuracy and requirements permit. Where I
have been obliged to use technical anatomical and physiological
terms I have either explained their meaning in the text, aided by
diagrams and figures, or I have given in brackets the English
equivalents of the terms used.</p>
<p>I trust my attempt to give a sketch of the mechanism of the
human voice, and how it is produced in speech and song, may prove
of interest to the general public, and I even hope that teachers of
voice production may find some of the pages dealing with the brain
mechanism not unworthy of their attention.</p>

<h2>THE BRAIN AND THE VOICE IN SPEECH AND SONG</h2>
<p>In the following pages on the Relation of the Brain to the
mechanism of the Voice in Speech and Song, I intend, as far as
possible, to explain the mechanism of the instrument, and what I
know regarding the cerebral mechanism by which the instrument is
played upon in the production of the singing voice and articulate
speech. Before, however, passing to consider in detail the
instrument, I will briefly direct your attention to some facts and
theories regarding the origin of speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="RULE4_2" name="RULE4_2"><!-- RULE4 2 --></a>
<h2>THEORIES ON THE ORIGIN OF SPEECH</h2>
<p>The evolutionary theory is thus propounded by Romanes in his
"Mental Evolution in Man," pp. 377-399: "Starting from the highly
intelligent and social species of anthropoid ape as pictured by
Darwin, we can imagine that this animal was accustomed to use its
voice freely for the <a id="page002" name="page002"><!-- pagenumber --></a>expression of the emotions, uttering danger
signals, and singing. Possibly it may also have been sufficiently
intelligent to use a few imitative sounds; and certainly sooner or
later the receptual life of this social animal must have advanced
far enough to have become comparable with that of an infant of
about two years of age. That is to say, this animal, although not
yet having begun to use articulate signs, must have advanced far
enough in the conventional use of natural signs (a sign with a
natural origin in tone and gesture, whether spontaneously or
intentionally imitative) to have admitted of a totally free
exchange of receptual ideas, such as would be concerned in animal
wants and even, perhaps, in the simplest forms of co-operative
action. Next I think it probable that the advance of receptual
intelligence which would have been occasioned by this advance in
sign-making would in turn have led to a development of the
latter&mdash;the two thus acting and reacting on each other until
the language of tone and gesture became gradually raised to the
level of imperfect pantomime, as in children before they begin to
use words. At this stage, however, or even before it, I think very
probably vowel sounds must have been employed in tone language, if
not also a <a id="page003" name="page003"><!-- pagenumber --></a>few consonants. Eventually the action and reaction of
receptual intelligence and conventional sign-making must have ended
in so far developing the former as to have admitted of the breaking
up (or articulation) of vocal sounds, as the only direction in
which any improvement in vocal sign-making was possible." Romanes
continues his sketch by referring to the probability that this
important stage in the development of speech was greatly assisted
by the already existing habit of articulating musical notes,
supposing our progenitors to have resembled the gibbons or the
chimpanzees in this respect. Darwin in his great work on the
"Expression of the Emotions" points to the fact that the gibbon,
the most erect and active of the anthropoid apes, is able to sing
an octave in half-tones, and it is interesting to note that Dubois
considers his Pithecanthropus Erectus is on the same stem as the
gibbon. But it has lately been shown that some animals much lower
in the scale than monkeys, namely, rodents, are able to produce
correct musical tones. Therefore the argument loses force that the
progenitors of man probably uttered musical sounds before they had
acquired the power of articulate speech, and that consequently,
when the voice is used under any strong <a id="page004" name="page004"><!-- pagenumber --></a>emotion, it tends to assume
through the principle of association a musical character. The work
of anthropologists and linguists, especially the former, supports
the progressive-evolution theory, which, briefly stated,
is&mdash;that articulate language is the result of an elaboration
in the long procession of ages in which there occurred three
stages&mdash;the cry, vocalisation, and articulation. The cry is
the primordial, pure animal language; it is a simple vocal
aspiration without articulation; it is either a reflex expressing
needs and emotions, or at a higher stage intentional (to call,
warn, menace, etc.). Vocalisation (emission of vowels) is a natural
production of the vocal instrument, and does not in itself contain
the essential elements of speech. Many animals are capable of
vocalisation, and in the child the utterance of vowel sounds is the
next stage after the cry.</p>
<p>The conditions necessary to the existence of speech arose with
articulation, and it is intelligence that has converted the vocal
instrument into the speaking instrument. For whereas correct
intonation depends upon the innate musical ear, which is able to
control and regulate the tensions of the minute muscles acting upon
the vocal cords, it is intelligence which alters and changes <a id="page005" name="page005"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the
form of the resonator by means of movement of the lips, tongue, and
jaw in the production of articulate speech. The simple musical
instrument in the production of phonation is bilaterally
represented in the brain, but as a speaking instrument it is
unilaterally represented in right-handed individuals in the left
hemisphere and in left-handed individuals in the right hemisphere.
The reason for this we shall consider later; but the fact supports
Darwin's hypothesis.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis which was brought forward by Grieger and
supported by some authors is summarised by Ribot as follows: "Words
are an imitation of the movements of the mouth. The predominant
sense in man is that of sight; man is pre-eminently visual. Prior
to the acquisition of speech he communicated with his fellows by
the aid of gestures and movement of the mouth and face; he appealed
to their eyes. Their facial 'grimaces,' fulfilled and elucidated by
gesture, became signs for others; they fixed their attention upon
them. When articulate sounds came into being, these lent themselves
to a more or less conventional language by reason of their acquired
importance." For support of this hypothesis the case of
non-educated deaf-mutes <a id="page006" name="page006"><!-- pagenumber --></a>is cited. They invent articulate sounds
which they cannot hear and use them to designate certain things.
Moreover, they employ gesture language&mdash;a language which is
universally understood.</p>
<p>Another theory of the origin of the speaking voice is that
speech is an instinct not evolved, but breaking forth spontaneously
in man; but even if this be so, it was originally so inadequate and
weak that it required support from the gesture language to become
intelligible. This mixed language still survives among some of the
inferior races of men. Miss Kingsley and Tylor have pointed out
that tribes in Africa have to gather round the camp fires at night
in order to converse, because their vocabulary is so incomplete
that without being reinforced by gesture and pantomime they would
be unable to communicate with one another. Gesture is indispensable
for giving precision to vocal sounds in many languages, e.g. those
of the Tasmanians, Greenlanders, savage tribes of Brazil, and
Grebos of Western Africa. In other cases speech is associated with
inarticulate sounds. These sounds have been compared to clicking
and clapping, and according to Sayce, these clickings and clappings
survive as though to show us how man when <a id="page007" name="page007"><!-- pagenumber --></a>deprived of speech can
fix and transmit his thoughts by certain sounds. These mixed states
represent articulate speech in its primordial state; they represent
the stage of transition from pure pantomime to articulate
speech.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that originally man had two languages at his
disposal which he used simultaneously or interchangeably. They
supported each other in the intercommunication of ideas, but speech
has triumphed because of its greater practical utility. The
language of gesture is disadvantageous for the following reasons:
(1) it monopolises the use of the hands; (2) it has the
disadvantage that it does not carry any distance; (3) it is useless
in the dark; (4) it is vague in character; (5) it is imitative in
nature and permits only of the intercommunication of ideas based
upon concrete images. Speech, on the other hand, is transmitted in
the dark and with objects intervening; moreover, distance affects
its transmission much less. The images of auditory and visual
symbols in the growth of speech replace in our minds concrete
images and they permit of abstract thought. It is dependent
primarily upon the ear, an organ of exquisite feeling, whose
sensations are infinite in number and in kind. This <a id="page008" name="page008"><!-- pagenumber --></a>sensory
receptor with its cerebral perceptor has in the long process of
time, aided by vision, under the influence of natural laws of the
survival of the fittest, educated and developed an instrument of
simple construction (primarily adapted only for the vegetative
functions of life and simple vocalisation) into that wonderful
instrument the human voice; but by that development, borrowing the
words of Huxley, "man has slowly accumulated and organised the
experience which is almost wholly lost with the cessation of every
individual life in other animals; so that now he stands raised as
upon a mountain-top, far above the level of his humble fellows, and
transfigured from his grosser nature by reflecting here and there a
ray from the infinite source of truth." Thought in all the higher
mental processes could not be carried on at all without the aid of
language.</p>
<p>Written language probably originated in an analytical process
analogous to the language of gesture. Like that, it: (1) isolates
terms; (2) arranges them in a certain order; (3) translates
thoughts in a crude and somewhat vague form. A curious example of
this may be found in Max M&uuml;ller's "Chips from a German
Workshop," XIV.: "The aborigines of the Caroline Islands <a id="page009" name="page009"><!-- pagenumber --></a>sent a
letter to a Spanish captain as follows: A man with extended arms,
sign of greeting; below to the left, the objects they have to
barter&mdash;five big shells, seven little ones, three others of
different forms; to the right, drawing of the objects they wanted
in exchange&mdash;three large fish-hooks, four small ones, two
axes, two pieces of iron."</p>
<p>Language of graphic signs and spoken language have progressed
together, and simultaneously supported each other in the
development of the higher mental faculties that differentiate the
savage from the brute and the civilised human being from the
savage. In spoken language, at any rate, it is not the vocal
instrument that has been changed, but the organ of mind with its
innate and invisible molecular potentialities, the result of racial
and ancestral experiences in past ages. Completely developed
languages when studied from the point of view of their evolution
are stamped with the print of an unconscious labour that has been
fashioning them for centuries. A little consideration and
reflection upon words which have been coined in our own time shows
that language offers an abstract and brief chronicle of social
psychology.</p>
<p>Articulate language has converted the vocal instrument into the
chief agent of the <a id="page010" name="page010"><!-- pagenumber --></a>will, but the brain in the process of time has
developed by the movements of the lips, tongue, jaw, and soft
palate a kin&aelig;sthetic<a href="#note-1">&sup1;</a> sense of
articulate speech, which has been integrated and associated in the
mind with rhythmical modulated sounds conveyed to the brain by the
auditory nerves. There has thus been a reciprocal simultaneity in
the development of these two senses by which the mental ideas of
spoken words are memorised and recalled. Had man been limited to
articulate speech he could not have made the immense progress he
has made in the development of complex mental processes, for
language, by using written verbal symbols, has allowed, not merely
the transmission of thought from one individual to another, but the
thoughts of the world, past and present, are in a certain measure
at the disposal of every individual. With this introduction to the
subject I will pass on to give a detailed description of the
instrument of the voice.</p>

<a id="page011" name="page011"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<h2>THE VOCAL INSTRUMENT</h2>
<p>A distinction is generally made in physics between sound and
noise. Noise affects our tympanic membrane as an irregular
succession of shocks and we are conscious of a jarring of the
auditory apparatus; whereas a musical sound is smooth and pleasant
because the tympanic membrane is thrown into successive periodic
vibrations to which the auditory receptor (sense organ of hearing)
has been attuned. To produce musical sounds, a body must vibrate
with the regularity of a pendulum, but it must be capable of
imparting sharper or quicker shocks to the air than the pendulum.
All musical sounds, however they are produced and by whatever means
they are propagated, may be distinguished by three different
qualities:</p>
<p>(1) Loudness, (2) Pitch, (3) Quality, timbre or klang, as the
Germans call it.</p>
<p>Loudness depends upon the amount of energy expended in producing
the sound. If I rub a tuning-fork with a well-rosined bow, I set it
in vibration by the resistance offered to the rosined hair; and if
while it is <a id="page012" name="page012"><!-- pagenumber --></a>vibrating I again apply the bow, thus expending more
energy, the note produced is louder. Repeating the action several
times, the width of excursion of the prongs of the tuning-fork is
increased. This I can demonstrate, not merely by the loudness of
the sound which can be heard, but by sight; for if a small mirror
be fixed on one of the prongs and a beam of light be cast upon the
mirror, the light being again reflected on to the screen, you will
see the spot of light dance up and down, and the more energetically
the tuning-fork is bowed the greater is the amplitude of the
oscillation of the spot of light. The duration of the time occupied
is the same in traversing a longer as in traversing a shorter
space, as is the case of the swinging pendulum. The vibrating
prongs of the tuning-fork throw the air into vibrations which are
conveyed to the ear and produce the sensation of sound. The
duration of time occupied in the vibrations of the tuning-fork is
therefore independent of the space passed over. The greater or less
energy expended does not influence the duration of time occupied by
the vibration; it only influences the amplitude of the
vibration.</p>
<p>The second quality of musical sounds is the pitch, and the pitch
depends upon the <a id="page013" name="page013"><!-- pagenumber --></a>number of vibrations that a sounding body makes in
each second of time. The most unmusical ear can distinguish a high
note from a low one, even when the interval is not great. Low notes
are characterised by a relatively small number of vibrations, and
as the pitch rises so the number of vibrations increase. This can
be proved in many ways. Take, for example, two tuning-forks of
different size: the shorter produces a considerably higher pitched
note than the longer one. If a mirror be attached to one of the
prongs of each fork, and a beam of light be cast upon each mirror
successively and then reflected in a revolving mirror, the
oscillating spot of light is converted into a series of waves; and
if the waves obtained by reflecting the light from the mirror of
the smaller one be counted and compared with those reflected from
the mirror attached to the larger fork, it will be found that the
number of waves reflected from the smaller fork is proportionally
to the difference in the pitch more numerous than the waves
reflected from the larger. The air is thrown into corresponding
periodic vibrations according to the rate of vibration of the
sound-producing body.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the quality, timbre, or klang <a id="page014" name="page014"><!-- pagenumber --></a>depends upon the
overtones, in respect to which I could cite many experiments to
prove that whenever a body vibrates, other bodies near it may be
set in vibration, but only on condition that such bodies shall be
capable themselves of producing the same note. A number of
different forms of resonators can be used to illustrate this law; a
law indeed which is of the greatest importance in connection with
the mechanism of the human voice. Although notes are of the same
loudness and pitch when played on different instruments or spoken
or sung by different individuals, yet even a person with no ear for
music can easily detect a difference in the quality of the sound
and is able to recognise the nature of the instrument or the timbre
of the voice. This difference in the timbre is due to harmonics or
overtones. Could we but see the sonorous waves in the air during
the transmission of the sound of a voice, we should see stamped on
it the conditions of motion upon which its characteristic qualities
depended; which is due to the fact that every vocal sound whose
vibrations have a complex form can be decomposed into a series of
simple notes all belonging to the harmonic series. These harmonics
or overtones will be considered <a id="page015" name="page015"><!-- pagenumber --></a>later when dealing with the timbre
or quality of the human voice.</p>
<p>The vocal instrument is unlike any other musical instrument; it
most nearly approaches a reed instrument. The clarionet and the
oboe are examples of reed instruments, in which the reed does not
alter but by means of stops the length of the column of air in the
resonating pipe varies and determines the pitch of the fundamental
note. The organ-pipe with the vibrating tongue of metal serving as
the reed is perhaps the nearest approach to the vocal organ; but
here again it is the length of the pipe which determines the pitch
of the note.</p>
<p>The vocal instrument may be said to consist of three parts: (1)
the bellows; (2) the membranous reed contained in the larynx, which
by the actions of groups of muscles can be altered in tension and
thus variation in pitch determined; (3) the resonator, which
consists of the mouth, the throat, the larynx, the nose, and air
sinuses contained in the bones of the skull, also the windpipe, the
bronchial tubes, and the lungs. The main and important part of the
resonator, however, is situated above the glottis (the opening
between the vocal cords, <i>vide</i> <a href="#image-6">fig. 6</a>), and it is capable of
only <a id="page016" name="page016"><!-- pagenumber --></a>slight variations in length and of many and important
variations in form. In the production of musical sounds its chief
influence is upon the quality of the overtones and therefore upon
the timbre of the voice; moreover, the movable structures of the
resonator, the lower jaw, the lips, the tongue, the soft palate,
can, by changing the form of the resonator, not only impress upon
the sound waves particular overtones as they issue from the mouth,
but simultaneously can effect the combination of vowels and
consonants with the formation of syllables, the combination of
syllables with the formation of words, and the combination of words
with the formation of articulate language. The reed portion of the
instrument acting alone can only express emotional feeling; the
resonator, the effector of articulate speech, is the instrument of
intelligence, will, and feeling. It must not, however, be thought
that the vocal instrument consists of two separately usable parts,
for phonation (except in the whispered voice) always accompanies
articulation.</p>
<p>In speech, and more especially in singing, there is an art of
breathing. Ordinary inspiration and expiration necessary for the
oxygenation of the blood is performed automatically and
unconsciously. But in singing the <a id="page017" name="page017"><!-- pagenumber --></a>respiratory apparatus is used
like the bellows of a musical instrument, and it is controlled and
directed by the will; the art of breathing properly is fundamental
for the proper production of the singing voice and the speaking
voice of the orator. It is necessary always to maintain in the
lungs, which act as the bellows, a sufficient reserve of air to
finish a phrase; therefore when the opportunity arises it is
desirable to take in as much air as possible through the nostrils,
and without any apparent effort; the expenditure of the air in the
lungs must be controlled and regulated by the power of the will in
such a manner as to produce efficiency in loudness with economy of
expenditure. It must be remembered, moreover, that mere loudness of
sound does not necessarily imply carrying power of the voice,
either when speaking or singing. Carrying power, as we shall see
later, depends as much upon the proper use of the resonator as upon
the force of expulsion of the air by the bellows. Again, a soft
note, especially an aspirate, owing to the vocal chink being widely
opened, may be the cause of an expenditure of a larger amount of
air than a loud-sounding note. Observations upon anencephalous
monsters (infants born without the great brain) show that breathing
and <a id="page018" name="page018"><!-- pagenumber --></a>crying can occur without the cerebral hemispheres; moreover,
Goltz's dog, in which all the brain had been removed except the
stem and base, was able to bark, growl, and snarl, indicating that
the primitive function of the vocal instrument can be performed by
the lower centres of the brain situated in the medulla oblongata.
But the animal growled and barked when the attendant, who fed it
daily, approached to give it food, which was a clear indication
that the bark and growl had lost both its affective and cognitive
significance; it was, indeed, a purely automatic reflex action. It
was dependent upon a stimulus arousing an excitation in an
instinctive automatic nervous mechanism in the medulla oblongata
and spinal cord presiding over synergic groups of muscles
habitually brought into action for this simplest form of
vocalisation, connected with the primitive emotion of anger.</p>

<blockquote>FIG. 1.&mdash;Front view of the thorax showing the
breastbone, to which on either side are attached the (shaded) rib
cartilages. The remainder of the thoracic cage is formed by the
ribs attached behind to the spine, which is only seen below. The
lungs are represented filling the chest cavity, except a little to
the left of the breastbone, below where the pericardium is shown
(black). It can be seen that the ribs slope forwards and downwards,
and that they increase in length from above downwards, so that if
elevated by the muscles attached to them, they will tend to push
forward the elastic cartilages and breastbone and so increase the
antero-posterior diameter of the chest; moreover, the ribs being
elastic will tend to give a little at the angle, and so the lateral
diameter of the chest will be increased.</blockquote>
<p>The bellows consists of the lungs enclosed in the movable
thorax. The latter may be likened to a cage; it is formed by the
spine behind and the ribs, which are attached by <a id="page019" name="page019"><!-- pagenumber --></a>cartilages to the
breastbone (sternum) in front (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-1">fig. 1</a>). The ribs and
cartilages, as the diagram shows, form a series of hoops which
increase in length from above downwards; moreover, they slope
obliquely downwards and inwards (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-2">fig. 2</a>). The ribs are
jointed behind to the vertebrae in such a way that muscles attached
to them can, by shortening, elevate them; the effect is that the
longer ribs are raised, and pushing forward the breastbone and
cartilages, the thoracic cage enlarges from before back; but being
elastic, the hoops will give a little and cause some expansion from
side to side; moreover, when the ribs are raised, each one is
rotated on its axis in such a way that the lower border tends
towards <a id="page020" name="page020"><!-- pagenumber --></a>eversion; the total effect of this rotation is a lateral
expansion of the whole thorax. Between the ribs and the cartilages
the space is filled by the intercostal muscles (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-2">fig. 2</a>),
the action of which, in conjunction with other muscles, is to
elevate the ribs. It is, however, unnecessary to enter into
anatomical details, and describe all those muscles which elevate
and rotate the ribs, and thereby cause enlargement of the thorax in
its antero-posterior and lateral diameters. There is, however, one
muscle which forms the floor of the thoracic cage called the
diaphragm that requires more than a passing notice (<i>vide</i>
<a href="#image-2">fig. 2</a>), inasmuch as it is the most effective agent in the
expansion of the chest. It consists of a <a id="page021" name="page021"><!-- pagenumber --></a>central tendinous portion,
above which lies the heart, contained in its bag or pericardium; on
either side attached to the central tendon on the one hand and to
the spine behind, to the last rib laterally, and to the cartilages
of the lowest six ribs anteriorly, is a sheet of muscle fibres
which form on either side of the chest a dome-like partition
between the lungs and the abdominal cavity (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-2">fig. 2</a>).
The phrenic nerve arises from the spinal cord in the upper cervical
region and descends through the neck and chest to the diaphragm; it
is therefore a special nerve of respiration. There are
two&mdash;one on each side supplying the two sheets of muscle
fibres. When innervation currents flow down these nerves the two
muscular halves of the diaphragm contract, and the floor of the
chest on either side descends; thus the vertical diameter
increases. Now the elastic lungs are covered with a smooth pleura
which is reflected from them on to the inner side of the wall of
the thorax, leaving no space between; consequently when the chest
expands in all three directions the elastic lungs expand
correspondingly. But when either voluntarily or automatically the
nerve currents that cause contraction of the muscles of expansion
cease, the elastic structures of <a id="page022" name="page022"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the lungs and thorax, including
the muscles, recoil, the diaphragm ascends, and the ribs by the
force of gravity tend to fall into the position of rest. During
expansion of the chest a negative pressure is established in the
air passages and air flows into them from without. In contraction
of the chest there is a positive pressure in the air passages, and
air is expelled; in normal quiet breathing an ebb and flow of air
takes place rhythmically and subconsciously; thus in the ordinary
speaking of conversation we do not require to exercise any
voluntary effort in controlling the breathing, but the orator and
more especially the singer uses his knowledge and experience in the
voluntary control of his breath, and he is thus enabled to use his
vocal instrument in the most effective manner.</p>

action would be to rotate and elevate the ribs. The dome-like shape

the central tendon is fixed and the sheet of muscle fibres on

flatten, allowing the lungs to expand vertically. The joints of the
ribs with the spine can be seen, and the slope of the surface of

also the diaphragm <i>d</i>' sinks deeper, but by the contraction
of the abdominal muscles the protrusion of the belly wall <i>d</i>
is much less than in normal breathing <i>b</i>.</blockquote>
<p>A glance at the diagram (<a href="#image-3">fig. 3</a>) shows the changes in the shape
of the thorax in normal subconscious automatic breathing, and the
changes in the voluntary conscious breathing of vocalisation. It
will be observed that there are marked differences: when voluntary
control is exercised, the expansion of the chest is greater in all
directions; moreover, by voluntary conscious effort the contraction
of the chest is much greater in all directions; the result is that
a larger <a id="page023" name="page023"><!-- pagenumber --></a>amount of air can be taken into the bellows and a larger
amount expelled. The mind can therefore bring into play at will
more muscular forces, and so control and regulate those forces as
to produce infinite variations in the pressure of the air in the
sound-pipe of the vocal instrument. But the forces which tend to
contract the chest and drive the air out of the lungs would be
ineffective if there were not simultaneously the power of closing
the sound-pipe; this we shall see is accomplished by the synergic
action of the muscles which make tense and approximate the vocal
cords. Although the elastic recoil of the lungs and the structure
of the expanded thorax is the main force employed in normal
breathing and to some extent in vocalisation (for it keeps up a
constant steady pressure), the mind, by exercising control over the
continuance of elevation of the ribs and contraction of the
abdominal muscles, regulates the force of the expiratory blast of
air so as to employ the bellows most efficiently in vocalisation.
Not only does the contraction of the abdominal muscles permit of
control over the expulsion of the air, but by fixing the cartilages
of the lowest six ribs it prevents the diaphragm drawing them
upwards and <i>inwards</i> (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-2">fig. 2</a>). The greatest
expansion is just above the waistband <a id="page025" name="page025"><!-- pagenumber --></a>(<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-3">fig. 3</a>). We are
not conscious of the contraction of the diaphragm; we are conscious
of the position of the walls of the chest and abdomen; the messages
the mind receives relating to the amount of air in the bellows at
our disposal come from sensations derived from the structures
forming the wall of the chest and abdomen, viz. the position of the
ribs, their degree of elevation and forward protrusion combined
with the feeling that the ribs are falling back into the position
of rest; besides there is the feeling that the abdominal muscles
can contract no more&mdash;a feeling which should never be allowed
to arise before we become conscious of the necessity of
replenishing the supply of air. This should <a id="page026" name="page026"><!-- pagenumber --></a>be effected by quickly
drawing in air through the nostrils without apparent effort and to
as full extent as opportunity offers between the phrases. By
intelligence and perseverance the guiding sense which informs the
singer of the amount of air at his disposal, and when and how it
should be replenished and voluntarily used, is of fundamental
importance to good vocalisation. Collar-bone breathing is
deprecated by some authorities, but I see no reason why the apices
of the lungs should not be expanded, and seeing the frequency with
which tubercle occurs in this region, it might by improving the
circulation and nutrition be even beneficial. The proper mode of
breathing comes almost natural to some individuals; to others it
requires patient cultivation under a teacher who understands the
art of singing and the importance of the correct methods of
breathing.</p>
<p>The more powerfully the abdominal muscles contract the laxer
must become the diaphragm muscle; and by the law of the reciprocal
innervation of antagonistic muscles it is probable that with the
augmented innervation currents to the expiratory centre of the
medulla there is a corresponding inhibition of the innervation
currents to the inspiratory centre (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-18">fig. 18</a>, page <a href="#page101">101</a>).
<a id="page027" name="page027"><!-- pagenumber --></a>These centres in the medulla preside over the centres in the spinal
cord which are in direct relation to the inspiratory and expiratory
muscles. It is, however, probable that there is a direct relation
between the brain and the spinal nerve centres which control the
costal and abdominal muscles independently of the respiratory
centres of the medulla oblongata (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-18">fig. 18</a>). The best
method of breathing is that which is most natural; there should not
be a protruded abdomen on the one hand, nor an unduly inflated
chest on the other hand; the maximum expansion should involve the
lower part of the chest and the uppermost part of the abdomen on a
level of an inch or more below the tip of the breastbone; the
expansion of the ribs should be maintained as long as possible. In
short phrases the movement may be limited to an ascent of the
diaphragm, over which we have not the same control as we have of
the elevation of the ribs; but it is better to reserve the costal
air, over which we have more voluntary control, for maintaining a
continuous pressure and for varying the pressure.</p>

<h2>II. THE REED</h2>

larynx, containing the reed portion of the vocal instrument.</p>

<blockquote>FIG. 4.&mdash;The cartilages of the larynx or
voice-box. A large portion of the shield cartilage on the right
side has been cut away, in order to show the two pyramid
cartilages; these are seen jointed by their bases with the ring
cartilage; anteriorly are seen the two vocal processes which give
attachment to the two vocal cords (white ligaments), which extend
across the voice-box to be inserted in front in the angle of the
shield cartilage. Groups of muscles pull upon these cartilages in
such a manner as to increase, or diminish, the chink between the
vocal cord in ordinary inspiration and expiration; in phonation a
group of muscles approximate the cords, while another muscle makes
them tense.</blockquote>
<p><i>The Larynx</i>.&mdash;The larynx is situated at the top of
the sound-pipe (trachea or windpipe), and consists of a framework
of cartilages articulated or jointed with one another so as to
permit of movement (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-4">fig. 4</a>). The cartilages are called
by names which indicate their form and shape: (1) shield or
thyroid, (2) the ring or cricoid, and (3) a pair of pyramidal or
arytenoid cartilages. Besides these there is the epiglottis, which
from its situation above the glottis acts more or less as a lid.
The shield cartilage is attached by ligaments and muscles to the
bone (hyoid) in the root of the tongue, a pair of muscles also
connect this cartilage with the sternum or breastbone. The ring
cartilage is attached to the windpipe by its lower border; by its
upper border in front it is connected with the inner surface of the
shield cartilage by a ligament; it is also jointed on either side
with the shield cartilage. The posterior part of the ring cartilage
is much wider than the anterior portion, and seated upon its upper
and posterior rim and articulated with <a id="page029" name="page029"><!-- pagenumber --></a>it by separate joints are
the two pyramidal cartilages (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-4">fig. 4</a>). The two vocal
cords as shown in the diagram are attached to the shield cartilage
in front, their attachments being close together; posteriorly they
are attached to the pyramidal cartilages. It is necessary, however,
to describe a little more fully these attachments. Extending
forwards from the base of the pyramids are processes termed the
"vocal processes," and these processes give attachment to the
elastic fibres of which the vocal cords mainly consist. There are
certain groups of muscles which by their attachment to the
cartilages of the larynx and their action on the joints are able to
separate the vocal cords or approximate them; these are termed
respectively abductor and adductor <a id="page030" name="page030"><!-- pagenumber --></a>muscles (figs. <a href="#image-5">5</a> and <a href="#image-6">6</a>). In
normal respiration the posterior ring-pyramidal muscles contract
synergically with the muscles of inspiration and by separating the
vocal cords open wide the glottis, whereby there is a free entrance
of air to the windpipe; during expiration this muscle ceases to
contract and the aperture of the glottis becomes narrower
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-10">fig. 10</a>). But when the pressure is required to be
raised in the air passages, as in the simple reflex act of coughing
or in vocalisation, the glottis must be closed by approximation of
the vocal cords, and this is effected by a group of muscles termed
the adductors, which pull on the pyramid cartilages in such a way
that the vocal processes are drawn towards one another in the
manner shown in <a href="#image-7">fig. 7</a>. Besides the abductor and adductor groups of
muscles, there is a muscle which acts in conjunction with the
adductor group, and by its attachments to the shield cartilage
above and the ring cartilage below makes tense the vocal cords
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-5">fig. 5</a>); it is of interest to note that this muscle
has a separate nerve supply to that of the abductor and adductor
muscles.</p>

</center>
<p>On the top of the pyramid cartilages, in the folds of mucous
membrane which cover the whole inside of the larynx are <a id="page031" name="page031"><!-- pagenumber --></a>two little
pieces of yellow elastic cartilage; and in the folds of mucous
membrane uniting these cartilages with the leaf-like lid cartilage
(epiglottis) is a thin sheet of muscle fibres which acts in
conjunction with the fibres between the two pyramid cartilages
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-8">fig. 8</a>). I must also direct especial attention to a
muscle belonging to the adductor group, which has another important
function especially related to vocalisation: it is sometimes called
the vocal muscle; it runs from the pyramid cartilage to the shield
cartilage; it apparently consists of two portions, an external,
which acts with the lateral ring-shield muscle and helps to
approximate the vocal cords; and another portion situated within
the vocal cord itself, which by contracting shortens the vocal cord
and probably allows only the free edge to vibrate; moreover, when
not contracting, by virtue of the perfect elasticity of muscle the
whole thickness of the cord, including this vocal muscle, can be
stretched and thrown into vibration (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-8">fig. 8</a>). In the
production of chest notes the whole vocal cord is vibrating, the
difference in the pitch depending upon the tension produced by the
contraction of the tensor (ring-shield) muscle. When, however, the
<a id="page032" name="page032"><!-- pagenumber --></a>change from the lower to the upper register occurs, as the
photographs taken by Dr. French and reproduced in a lecture at the
Royal Institution by Sir Felix Semon show, the vocal cords become
shorter, thicker, and rounder; and this can be explained by
supposing that the inner portion of the vocal muscle contracts at
the break from the lower to the upper register (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-11">fig. 11</a>);
and that as a result only the free edges of the cords vibrate,
causing a change in the quality of the tone. As the scale is
ascended the photographs show that the cords become longer and
tenser, which we may presume is due to the continued action of the
tensor muscle. Another explanation is possible, viz. that in the
lower register the two edges of the vocal cords are comparatively
thick strings. When the break occurs, owing to the contraction of
the inner portion of the vocal muscle, we have a transformation
into thin strings, at first short, but as the pitch of the note
rises, the thin string formed by the edge of the vocal cord is
stretched and made longer by the tensor. It should <a id="page033" name="page033"><!-- pagenumber --></a>be mentioned
that Aikin and many other good authorities do not hold this
view.</p>

the mid line.</blockquote>
<p>A diagram showing a vertical section through the middle of the
larynx at right angles to the vocal cords shows some important
facts in connection with the mechanism of this portion of the vocal
instrument (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-8">fig. 8</a>). It will be observed that the
sound-pipe just beneath the membranous reed assumes the form of a
cone, thus the expired air is driven like a wedge against the
closed glottis. Another fact of importance may be observed, that
above the vocal cords on either side is a pouch called a ventricle,
and the upper surfaces of the vocal cords slope somewhat upwards
from without inwards, so that the pressure of the air from above
tends to press the edges together. The force of the expiratory
blast of air from below overcomes the forces which approximate the
edges of the cords and throws them into vibration. With each
vibration of the membranous reeds the valve is opened, and as in
the case <a id="page034" name="page034"><!-- pagenumber --></a>of the siren a little puff of air escapes; thus successive
rhythmical undulations of the air are produced, constituting the
sound waves. The pitch of the note depends upon the number of waves
per second, and the <i>register</i> of the voice therefore depends
upon two factors: (1) the size of the voice-box, or larynx, and the
length of the cords, and (2) the action of the neuro-muscular
mechanism whereby the length, approximation, and tension of the
vocal cords can be modified when singing from the lowest note to
the highest note of the register.</p>
<p>Thus the compass of the&mdash;</p>
<pre>
  Bass voice is D to f     75- 354 vibs. per sec.
  Tenor      "  c "  c''  133- 562   "      "

<p>The complete compass of the human voice therefore ranges from
about D 75 to f''' 1417 vibrations per second, but the quality of
the same notes varies in different individuals.</p>

<blockquote>Fig. 9.&mdash;<i>Description of the laryngoscope and
its mode of use</i>.&mdash;The laryngoscope consists of a concave
mirror which is fixed on the forehead with a band in such a way
that the right eye looks through the hole in the middle. This
mirror reflects the light from a lamp placed behind the right side
of the patient, who is told to open the mouth and put out the
tongue. The observer holds the tongue out gently with a napkin and
reflects the light from the mirror on his forehead on to the back
of the throat. The small mirror, set at an angle of 45&deg; with
the shaft, is of varying size, from half an inch to one inch in
diameter, and may be fixed in a handle according to the size
required. The mirror is warmed to prevent the moisture of the
breath obscuring the image, and it is introduced into the back of
the throat in such a manner that the glottis appears reflected in
it. The light from the lamp is reflected by the concave mirror on
to the small mirror, which, owing to its angle of 45&deg;,
illuminates the glottis and reflects the image of the glottis with
the vocal cords.</blockquote>
<p>The discovery of the laryngoscope by Garcia enabled him by its
means to see the vocal cords in action and how the reed portion of
the vocal instrument works (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-9">fig. 9</a> and description).
The chink of the <a id="page035" name="page035"><!-- pagenumber --></a>glottis or the opening between the vocal cords as
seen in the mirror of the laryngoscope varies in size. The vocal
cords or ligaments appear dead white and contrast with the
surrounding pink mucous membrane covering the remaining structures
of the larynx. <a href="#image-10">Fig. 10</a> shows the appearance of the glottis in
respiration and vocalisation. The vocal cords of a man are about
seven-twelfths of an inch in length, and those of a boy (before the
voice breaks) or of a woman are about five-twelfths of an inch; and
there is a corresponding difference in size of the voice-box or
larynx. This difference <a id="page036" name="page036"><!-- pagenumber --></a>in length of the vocal cords accounts for
the difference in the pitch of the speaking voice and the register
of the singing voice of the two sexes. We should also expect a
constant difference in the length of the cords of a tenor and a
bass in the male, and of the contralto and soprano in the female,
but such is not the case. It is not possible to determine by
laryngoscopic examination what is the natural register of an
individual's voice. The vocal cords may be as long in the tenor as
in the bass; this shows what an important part the resonator plays
in the timbre or quality of the voice. Still, it is generally
speaking true, that a small larynx is more often associated with a
higher pitch of voice than a large larynx.</p>

<a id="page037" name="page037"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<p>Musical notes are comprised between 27 and 4000 vibrations per
second. The extent and limit of the voice may be given as between C
65 vibrations per second and f''' 1417 vibrations per second, but
this is most exceptional, it is seldom above c''' 1044 per second.
The compass of a well-developed singer is about two to two and a
half octaves. The normal pitch, usually called the "diapason
normal," is that of a tuning-fork giving 433 vibrations per second.
Now what does the laryngoscope teach regarding the change occurring
in the vocal cords during the singing of the two to two and a half
octaves? If the vocal cords are observed by means of the
laryngoscope during phonation, no change is <i>seen</i>, owing to
the rapidity of the vibrations, although a scale of an octave may
be sung; in the lower notes, however, the vocal cords are seen not
so closely approximated as in the very high notes. This may account
for the difficulty experienced in singing high notes piano. Sir
Felix Semon in a Friday evening lecture at the Royal Institution
showed some remarkable photographs, by Dr. French, of the larynx of
two great singers, a contralto and a high soprano, during
vocalisation, which exhibit changes in the length of the vocal
cords and <a id="page038" name="page038"><!-- pagenumber --></a>in the size of the slit between them. Moreover, the
photographs show that the vocal cords at the break from the lower
to the upper register exhibit characteristic changes.</p>

in Sir Felix Semon's lecture on the Voice, (1) Appearance of vocal
cords of contralto singer when singing F# to D; it will be observed
that the cords increase in length with the rise of the pitch,
presumably the whole cord is vibrating, including the inner strand
of the vocal muscle. At the break from D to E (3 and 4) the cords
suddenly become shorter and thicker; presumably the inner portion
of the vocal muscle (thyro-arytenoid) is contracting strongly,
permitting only the edge of the cord to vibrate. For the next
octave the cords are stretched longer and longer; this may be
explained by the increasing force of contraction of the tensor
muscle stretching the cords and the contained muscle, which is also
contracted.</blockquote>
<p>When we desire to produce a particular vocal sound, a mental
perception of the sound, which is almost instinctive in a person
with a musical ear, awakens by association motor centres in the
brain that preside over the innervation currents necessary for the
approximation and minute alterations in the tensions of the vocal
cords requisite for the production of a particular note. We are not
conscious of any kin&aelig;sthetic (sense of movement) guiding
sensations from the laryngeal muscles, but we are of the muscles of
the tongue, lips, and jaw in the production of articulate <a id="page039" name="page039"><!-- pagenumber --></a>sounds.
It is remarkable that there are hardly any sensory nerve endings in
the vocal cords and muscles of the larynx, consequently it is not
surprising to find that the ear is the guiding sense for correct
modulation of the loudness and pitch of the speaking as well as the
singing voice. In reading music, visual symbols produced by one
individual awakens in the mind of another mental auditory
perceptions of sound varying in pitch, duration, and loudness.
Complex neuro-muscular mechanisms preside over these two functions
of the vocal instrument. The instrument is under the control of the
will as regards the production of the notes in loudness and
duration, but not so as regards pitch; for without the untaught
instinctive sense of the mental perception of musical sounds
correct intonation cannot be obtained by any effort of the will.
The untaught ability of correct appreciation of variations in the
pitch of notes and the memorising and producing of the same vocally
are termed a musical ear. A gift even to a number of people of poor
intelligence, it may or may not be associated with the sense of
rhythm, which, as we have seen, is dependent upon the mental
perception of successive movements associated with a sound. Both
correct modulation and <a id="page040" name="page040"><!-- pagenumber --></a>rhythm are essential for melody. The sense
of hearing is the primary incitation to the voice. This accounts
for the fact that children who have learnt to speak, and suffer in
early life with ear disease, lose the use of their vocal instrument
unless they are trained by lip language and imitation to speak. The
remarkable case of Helen Keller, who was born blind and deaf, and
yet learned by the tactile motor sensibility of the fingers to feel
the vibrations of the vocal organ and translate the perceptions of
these vibrations into movements of the lips and tongue necessary
for articulation, is one of the most remarkable facts in
physiological psychology. Her voice, however, was monotonous, and
lacked the modulation in pitch of a musical voice. Music meant
little to her but beat and pulsation. She could not sing and she
could not play the piano. The fact that Beethoven composed some of
his grandest symphonies when stone deaf shows the extraordinary
musical faculty he must have preserved to bear in his mind the
grand harmonies that he associated with visual symbols. Still, it
is impossible that Beethoven, had he been deaf in his early
childhood, could ever have developed into the great musical genius
that he became.</p>

<h2>III. THE RESONATOR AND ARTICULATOR</h2>
<p><i>The Resonator</i>.&mdash;The resonator is an irregular-shaped
tube with a bend in the middle; the vertical portion is formed by
the larynx and pharynx, the horizontal by the mouth. The length of
the resonator, from the vocal cords to the lips, is about 6.5 to 7
inches (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-12">fig. 12</a>). The walls of the vertical portion are
formed by the vertebral column and the muscles of the pharynx
behind, the cartilages of the larynx and the muscles of the pharynx
at the sides, and the thyroid cartilage, the epiglottis, and the
root of the tongue in front; these structures form the walls of the
throat and are all covered with a mucous membrane. This portion of
the <a id="page042" name="page042"><!-- pagenumber --></a>resonator passage can be enlarged to a slight degree by
traction upon the larynx below (sterno-thyroid muscle), by
looseness of the pharyngeal muscles, and still more by the forward
placement of the tongue; the converse is true as regards diminution
in size. The horizontal portion of the resonator tube (the mouth)
has for its roof the soft palate and the hard palate, the tongue
for its floor, and cheeks, lips, jaw, and teeth for its walls. The
interior dimensions of this portion of the resonator can be greatly
modified by movements of the jaw, the soft palate, and the tongue,
while the shape and form of its orifice is modified by the
lips.</p>
<p>There are accessory resonator cavities, and the most important
of these is the nose; its cavity is entirely enclosed in bone and
cartilage, consequently it is immovable; this cavity may or may not
be closed to the sonorous waves by the elevation of the soft
palate. When the mouth is closed, as in the production of the
consonant m, e.g. in singing <i>me</i>, a nasal quality is imparted
to the voice, and if a mirror be placed under the nostrils it will
be seen by the vapour on it that the sound waves have issued from
the nose; consequently the nasal portion of the resonator has
imparted its characteristic quality to the sound. The air <a id="page043" name="page043"><!-- pagenumber --></a>sinuses
in the upper jaws, frontal bones, and sphenoid bones act as
accessory resonators; likewise the bronchi, windpipe, and lungs;
but all these are of lesser importance compared with the principal
resonating chamber of the mouth and throat. If the mouth be closed
and a tune be hummed the whole of the resonating chambers are in
action, and the sound being emitted from the nose the nasal quality
is especially marked. But no sound waves are produced unless the
air finds an exit; thus a tune cannot be hummed if both mouth and
nostrils are closed.</p>
<p>From the description that I have given above, it will be
observed that the mouth, controlled by the movements of the jaw,
tongue, and lips, is best adapted for the purpose of articulate
speech; and that the throat, which is less actively movable and
contains the vocal cords, must have greater influence on the sound
vibrations without participating in the articulation of words.
While the vocal cords serve the purpose of the reed, the resonator
forms the body of the vocal instrument. Every sound passes through
it; every vowel and consonant in the production of syllables and
words must be formed by it, and the whole character and individual
qualities of the speaking <a id="page044" name="page044"><!-- pagenumber --></a>as well as the singing voice depend in
great part upon the manner in which it is used.</p>
<p>The acoustic effect is due to the resonances generated by hollow
spaces of the resonator, and Dr. Aikin, in his work on "The Voice,"
points out that we can study the resonances yielded by these hollow
spaces by whispering the vocal sounds; but it is necessary to put
the resonator under favourable conditions for the most efficient
production. When a vowel sound is whispered the glottis is open
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-10">fig. 10</a>) and the vocal cords are not thrown into
vibration; yet each vowel sound is associated with a distinct
musical note, and we can produce a whole octave by alteration of
the resonator in whispering the vowel sounds. In order to do this
efficiently it is necessary to use the bellows and the resonator to
the best advantage; therefore, after taking a deep inspiration in
the manner previously described, the air is expelled through the
open glottis into the resonating cavity, which (as <a href="#image-13">fig. 13</a> shows)
is placed under different conditions according to the <a id="page045" name="page045"><!-- pagenumber --></a>particular
vowel sound whispered. In all cases the mouth is opened, keeping
the front teeth about one inch apart; the tongue should be in
contact with the lower dental arch and lie as flat on the floor of
the mouth as the production of the particular vowel sound will
permit. When this is done, and a vowel sound whispered, a
distinctly resonant note can be heard. Helmholtz and a number of
distinguished German physicists and physiologists have analysed the
vowel sounds in the whispering voice and obtained very different
results. If their experiments show nothing else, they certainly
indicate that there are no universally fixed resonances for any
particular vowel sound. Some of the discrepancies may (as Aikin
points out) be due to the conditions of the experiment not being
conducted under the same conditions. Aikin, indeed, asserts that if
the directions given above be fulfilled, there will be variations
between full-grown men and women of one or two tones, and between
different men and different women of one or two semi-tones, and not
much more. As he truly affirms, if the tube is six inches long a
variation of three-quarters of an inch could only make a difference
of a whole tone in the resonance, and he implies that the different
results obtained by these different experimenters were due to the
faulty use of the resonator.</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation much faulty pronunciation is overlooked
so long as the words themselves are intelligible, but in <a id="page046" name="page046"><!-- pagenumber --></a>singing
and public speaking every misuse of the resonator is magnified and
does not pass unnoticed. Increased loudness of the voice will not
improve its carrying power if the resonator is improperly used; it
will often lead to a rise of pitch and the production of a harsh,
shrill tone associated with a sense of strain and effort. Aikin
claims that by studying the whispering voice we can find for every
vowel sound that position of the resonator which gives us the
maximum of resonance. By percussing<a href="#note-2">&sup2;</a> the
resonator in the position for the production of the various vowel
sounds you will observe a distinct difference in the pitch of the
note produced. I will first produce the vowel sound <i>oo</i> and
proceed with the vowel sounds to <i>i</i>; you will observe that
the pitch rises an octave; that this is due to the changes in the
form of the resonator is shown when I percuss the resonator in the
position of the different vowel sounds. You will observe that I
start the scale of C with <i>oo</i> on f and proceed through a
series of vowel sounds as in whispering <i>who</i>, <i>owe</i>,
<i>or</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>ah</i>. I rise a fifth from f to c, and
the diagram shows <a id="page047" name="page047"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the change in the form of the resonator cavity to
be mainly due to the position of the dorsum of the tongue.
Proceeding from <i>ah</i> to the middle tone of the speaking
register, we ascend the scale to <i>i</i> as in <i>me</i>, and the
dorsum of the tongue now reaches the roof of the mouth; but the
tongue not only rises, it comes forward, and the front segment of
the resonator is made a little smaller at every step of the scale
while the back segment becomes a little larger. I consider this
diagram of Aikin to be more representative of the changes in the
resonator than the description of Helmholtz, who stated that the
form of the resonator during the production of the vowel sound
<i>u</i> and <i>o</i> is that of a globular flask with a short
neck; during the production of <i>a</i> that of a funnel with the
wide extremity directed forward; of <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> that of a
globular flask with a long narrow neck.</p>

<p>I have already said that Helmholtz showed that each vowel sound
has its particular overtones, and the quality or "timbre" of the
voice depends upon the <a id="page048" name="page048"><!-- pagenumber --></a>proportional strength of these overtones.
Helmholtz was able by means of resonators to find out what were the
overtones for each vowel sound when a particular note was sung. The
flame manometer of K&ouml;nig (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-14">fig. 14</a>) shows that if
the same note be sung with different vowels the serrated flame
image in the mirror is different for each vowel, and if a more
complicated form of this instrument be used (such as I show you in
a picture on the screen) the overtones of the vowel sounds can be
analysed. You will observe that this instrument consists of a
number of resonators placed in front of a series of membranes which
cover capsules, each capsule being connected with a jet of gas.</p>

<blockquote>FIG. 14.&mdash;K&ouml;nig's flame manometer. The
fundamental note C is sung on a vowel sound in front of the
instrument; the lowest resonator is proper to that note and the air
in it is thrown into corresponding periodic rhythmical vibrations,
which are communicated through an intervening membrane to the gas
in the capsule at the back of the resonator; but the gas is
connected with the lighted jet, the flame of which is reflected in
the mirror, the result being that the flame vibrates. When the
mirror is made to revolve by turning the handle the reflected image
shows a number of teeth corresponding to the number of vibrations
produced by the note which was sung. The remaining resonators of
the harmonic series with their capsules and gas-jets respond in the
same manner to the overtones proper to each vowel sound when the
fundamental note is sung.</blockquote>
<a id="page049" name="page049"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<p>Each resonator corresponds from below upwards to the harmonics
of the fundamental note c. In order to know if the sound of the
voice contains harmonics and what they are, it is necessary to sing
the fundamental note c on some particular vowel sound; the
resonators corresponding to the particular harmonics of the vowel
sound are thus set in action, and a glance at the revolving mirror
shows which particular gas jets vibrate. Experiments conducted with
this instrument show that the vowel <i>U=oo</i> is composed of the
fundamental note very strong and the third harmonic (viz. g) is
fairly pronounced.</p>
<p><i>O</i> (<i>on</i>) contains the fundamental note, the second
harmonic (the octave c') very strong, and the third and fourth
harmonics but weak.</p>
<p>The vowel <i>A</i> (<i>ah</i>) contains besides the fundamental
note, the second harmonic, weak; the third, strong; and the fourth,
weak.</p>
<p>The vowel <i>E</i> (<i>a</i>) has relatively a feeble
fundamental note, the octave above, the second harmonic, is weak,
and the third weak; whereas the fourth is very strong, and the
fifth weak.</p>
<p>The vowel <i>I</i> (<i>ee</i>) has very high harmonics,
especially the fifth, which is strongly marked.</p>
<a id="page050" name="page050"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<p>We see from these facts that there is a correspondence between
the existence of the higher harmonics and the diminished length of
the resonator. They are not the same in all individuals; for they
depend also upon the <i>timbre</i> of the voice of the person
pronouncing them, or the special character of the language used, as
well as upon the pitch of the fundamental notes employed.</p>
<p>Helmholtz inferred that if the particular quality of the vowel
sounds is due to the reinforcement of the fundamental tone by
particular overtones, he ought to be able to produce synthetically
these vowel sounds by combining the series of overtones with the
fundamental note. This he actually accomplished by the use of
stopped organ pipes which gave sensibly simple notes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Having thus shown that the fundamental note is dependent upon
the tension of the vocal cords&mdash;the reed portion of the
instrument&mdash;and the quality, timbre, or "klang" upon the
resonator, I will pass on to the formation of syllables and words
of articulate speech by the combination of vowel sounds and
consonants.</p>
<p>"The articulate sounds called consonants are sounds produced by
the vibrations of <a id="page051" name="page051"><!-- pagenumber --></a>certain easily movable portions of the mouth and
throat; and they have a different sound according as they are
accompanied by voice or not" (Hermann).</p>
<p>The emission of sounds from the resonator may be modified by
interruption or constriction in three situations, at each of which
added vibrations may occur, (1) At the lips, the constriction being
formed by the two lips, or by the upper or lower lip with the lower
or upper dental arch. (2) Between the tongue and the palate, the
constriction being caused by the opposition of the tip of the
tongue to the anterior portion of the hard palate or the posterior
surface of the dental arch. (3) At the fauces, the constriction
being due to approximation of the root of the tongue and the soft
palate. Consonants can only be produced in conjunction with a vowel
sound, consequently the air is thrown into sonorous waves of a
complex character, in part dependent upon the shape of the
resonator for the production of the vowel, in part dependent upon
the vibrations at each of these situations mentioned above.
Consonants may accordingly be classified as they are formed at the
three places of interruption&mdash;lips, teeth, and fauces
respectively: (1) labial; (2) dental; (3) guttural.</p>
<a id="page052" name="page052"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<p>The sounds formed at each of the places of interruption are
divided into&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>Explosives</i>.&mdash;At one of the
situations mentioned the resonator is suddenly opened or closed
during the expulsion of air&mdash;(<i>a</i>) without the aid of
voice, p, t, k; (<i>b</i>) with the aid of voice, b, d, g. When one
of these consonants begins a syllable, opening of the resonator is
necessary, e.g. pa; when it ends a syllable, closure is necessary,
e.g. ap. No sharp distinction is possible between p and b, t and d,
and k and g if they are whispered.</p>
<p>2. <i>Aspirates</i>.&mdash;The resonator is constricted at one
of the points mentioned so that the current of air either expired
or inspired rushes through a small slit. Here again we may form two
classes: (<i>a</i>) without the aid of the voice, f, s (sharp), ch,
guttural; (<i>b</i>) with the aid of voice, v, z, y. The consonants
s and l are formed when the passage in front is closed by elevation
of the tongue against the upper dental arch so that the air can
only escape at the sides between the molar teeth: sh is formed by
the expulsion of the current of air through two narrow slits, viz.
(1) between the front of the tongue and the hard palate, the other
between the nearly closed teeth. If a space <a id="page053" name="page053"><!-- pagenumber --></a>be left between the tip
of the tongue and the upper teeth two consonant sounds can be
produced, one without the aid of the voice&mdash;th (hard) as in
that; the other with the aid of voice&mdash;th (soft) as in
thunder. Ch is a guttural produced near the front of the mouth,
e.g. in Christ, or near the back as in Bach.</p>
<p>3. <i>Resonants</i>.&mdash;In the production of the consonant m,
and sometimes n, the nasal resonator comes into play because the
soft palate is not raised at all and the sound waves produced in
the larynx find a free passage through the nose, while the mouth
portion of the resonator is completely closed by the lips. The
sounds thus produced are very telling in the singing voice.</p>
<p>4. <i>Vibratory Sounds</i>.&mdash;There are three situations in
which the consonant r may be formed, but in the English language it
is produced by the vibration of the tip of the tongue in the
constricted portion of the cavity of the mouth, formed by the
tongue and the teeth.</p>
<a id="page054" name="page054"><!-- pagenumber --></a>

<p>Aikin, moreover, points out that the English language is so full
of closures that it is difficult to keep the resonator open, and
that accounts for one of the principal difficulties in singing
it.</p>
<p>"The converse of this may be said of Italian, in which most
words end in pure vowels which keep the resonator open. In fact, it
is this circumstance which has made the Italian language the basis
of every point of voice culture and the producer of so many
wonderful singers." As an example compare the English word 'voice,'
which begins with closure and ends with closure, and the Italian
'voce,' pronounced <i>voch&eacute;</i>, with its two open vowel
sounds. The vowel sound ah on the note c is the middle tone of the
speaking register, and as we know, can be used all day long without
fatigue; therefore in training the voice the endeavour should be
made to develop the register above and below this middle tone. In
speaking there is always a tendency under emotional excitement,
especially if associated with anger, to raise the pitch of the
voice, whereas the tender emotions lead rather to a lowering of the
pitch. Interrogation generally leads to a rise of the pitch; thus,
as Helmholtz pointed out, in the following sentence there is a
decided <a id="page056" name="page056"><!-- pagenumber --></a>fall in the pitch&mdash;"I have been for a walk"; whereas
in "Have you been for a walk?" there is a decided rise of pitch. If
you utter the sentence "Who are you?" there is a very definite rise
of pitch on 'are.'</p>

<h2>PATHOLOGICAL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES PRODUCING SPEECH DEFECTS AND
WHAT THEY TEACH</h2>
<p>As I have before remarked, children utter vowel sounds before
consonants, and I used this as an argument that phonation preceded
articulation; but there is another reason for supposing that
articulate sounds are of later development phylogenetically, as
well as ontogenetically. Not only are they more dependent for their
proper production on intelligence, but in those disorders of speech
which occur as a result of degenerative processes of the central
nervous system the difficulty of articulate speech precedes that of
phonation. Take, for example, bulbar paralysis, a form of
progressive muscular atrophy, a disease due to a progressive decay
and destruction of the motor nerve cells presiding over the
movements of the tongue, lips, and larynx, hence often called
glosso-labial-laryngeal palsy. In this disease the lips, tongue,
throat, and often the larynx are paralysed on both sides. "The
symptoms are, so to speak, grouped about the tongue as a centre,
<a id="page058" name="page058"><!-- pagenumber --></a>and it is in this organ that the earliest symptoms are usually
manifested." (Gowers). Imperfect articulation of those sounds in
which the tongue is chiefly concerned, viz. the lingual consonants
l, r, n, and t, causing indistinctness of speech, is the first
symptom; the lips then become affected and there is difficulty in
the pronunciation of sounds in which the lips are concerned, viz.
u, o, p, b, and m. Eventually articulate speech becomes impossible,
and the only expression remaining to the patient is laryngeal
phonation, slightly modulated and broken into the rhythm of
formless syllables.</p>
<p>The laryngeal palsy <i>rarely</i> becomes complete. The nervous
structures in the <i>physiological mechanism</i> of speech and
phonation are affected in this disease; but there are degenerative
diseases of the brain in which the <i>psychical mechanism</i> of
speech is affected, e.g. General Paralysis of the Insane, in which
the affection of speech and hand-writing is quite characteristic.
There is at first a hesitancy which may only be perceptible to
practised ears, but in which there is no real fault of articulation
once it is started; sometimes preparatory to and during the
utterance there is a tremulous motion about the muscles of the
<a id="page059" name="page059"><!-- pagenumber --></a>mouth. The hesitation increases, and instead of a steady flow of
modulated, articulate sounds, speech is broken up into a succession
of irregular, jerky, syllabic fragments, without modulation, and
often accompanied by a tremulous vibration of the voice. Syllables
are unconsciously dropped out, blurred, or run into one another, or
imperfectly uttered; especially is difficulty found with
consonants, particularly explosive sounds, b, p, m; again, linguals
and dentals are difficult to utter. Similar defects occur in
written as in vocal speech; the syllables and even the letters are
disjointed; there is a fine tremor in the writing, and
inco-ordination in the movements of the pen. Silent thoughts leave
out syllables and words in the framing of sentences; consequently
they are not expressed by the hand. The ideation of a written or
spoken word is based upon the association of the component
syllables, and the difficulty arises primarily from the progressive
impairment of this function of association upon which spoken and
written language so largely depends. Examination of the brain in
this disease explains the cause of the speech trouble and the
progressive dementia (loss of mind) and paralysis with which it is
associated. There is a wasting of <a id="page060" name="page060"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the cerebral hemispheres,
especially of the frontal lobes, a portion of the brain which,
later on, we shall see is intimately associated with the function
of articulate speech.</p>

<a id="RULE4_8" name="RULE4_8"><!-- RULE4 8 --></a>
<h2>THE CEREBRAL MECHANISM OF SPEECH AND SONG</h2>
<p>Neither vocalisation nor articulation are essentially human.
Many of the lower animals, e.g. parrots, possess the power of
articulate speech, and birds can be taught to pipe tunes. The
essential difference between the articulate speech of the parrot
and the human being is that the parrot merely imitates sounds, it
does not employ these articulate sounds to express judgments;
likewise there are imbecile human beings who, parrot-like, repeat
phrases which are meaningless. Articulate speech, even when
employed by a primitive savage, always expresses a judgment. Even
in the simple psychic process of recalling the name aroused by the
sight of a common object in daily use, and in affixing the verbal
sign to that object, a judgment is expressed. But that judgment is
based upon innumerable experiences primarily acquired through our
special senses, whereby we have obtained a knowledge <a id="page061" name="page061"><!-- pagenumber --></a>of the
properties and uses of the object. This statement implies that the
whole brain is consciously and unconsciously in action. There is,
however, a concentration of psychic action in those portions of the
brain which are essential for articulate speech; consequently the
word, as it is mentally heard, mentally seen, and mentally felt (by
the movements of the jaw, tongue, lips, and soft palate), occupies
the field of clear consciousness; but the concept is also the
nucleus of an immense constellation of subconscious psychic
processes with which it has been associated by experiences in the
past. In language, articulate sounds are generally employed as
objective signs attached to objects with which they have no natural
tie.</p>
<p>In considering the relation of the Brain to the Voice we have
not only a physiological but a psychological problem to deal with.
Since language is essentially a human attribute, we can only study
the relation of the Brain to Speech by observations on human beings
who during life have suffered from various speech defects, and then
correlate these defects with the anatomical changes found in the
brain after death.</p>
<p>Between the vocal instrument of the primitive savage and that of
the most cultured <a id="page062" name="page062"><!-- pagenumber --></a>singer or orator there is little or no
discoverable difference; neither by careful naked-eye inspection of
the brain, nor aided by the highest powers of the microscope,
should we be able to discover any sufficient structural difference
to account for the great difference in the powers of performance of
the vocal instrument of the one as compared with that of the other;
nor is there any sufficient difference in size or minute structure
of the brain to account for the vast store of intellectual
experiences and knowledge of the one as compared with the other.
The cultured being descended from cultured beings inherits
tendencies whereby particular modes of motion or vibration which
have been experienced by ancestors are more readily aroused in the
central nervous system; when similar stimuli producing similar
modes of motion affect the sense organs. But suppose there were an
island inhabited only by deaf mutes, upon which a ship was wrecked,
and the sole survivors of the wreck were infants who had never used
the voice except for crying, would these infants acquire articulate
speech and musical vocalisation? I should answer, No. They would
only be able to imitate the deaf mutes in their gesture language
and possibly the <a id="page063" name="page063"><!-- pagenumber --></a>musical sounds of birds; for the language a child
learns is that which it hears; they might however develop a simple
natural language to express their emotions by vocal sounds. The
child of English-speaking parents would not be able spontaneously
to utter English words if born in a foreign country and left soon
after birth amongst people who could not speak a word of English,
although it would possess a potential facility to speak the
language of its ancestors and race.</p>
<p>It is necessary, however, before proceeding further, to say a
few words explanatory of the brain and its structure, and the
reader is referred to figs. <a href="#image-15">15</a>, <a href="#image-16">16</a>, <a href="#image-17">17</a>. The brain consists of (1)
the great brain or cerebrum, (2) the small brain or cerebellum, and
(3) the stem of the brain, which is continuous with the spinal
cord. The cerebro-spinal axis consists of grey matter and white
matter. The grey matter covers the surface of the cerebrum and
cerebellum, the white matter being internal. The stem of the brain,
the medulla oblongata, and the spinal cord, consists externally of
white matter, the grey matter being internal. The grey matter
consists for the most part of nerve cells (ganglion cells), and the
white matter consists of nerve fibres; it is white <a id="page064" name="page064"><!-- pagenumber --></a>on account of
the phosphoretted fatty sheath&mdash;myelin&mdash;that covers the
essential axial conducting portion of the nerve fibres. If,
however, the nervous system be examined microscopically by suitable
staining methods, it will be found that the grey and white matters
are inseparably connected, for the axial fibres of the nerves in
the white matter are really prolongations of the ganglion cells of
the grey matter; in fact the nervous system consists of countless
myriads of nervous units or neurones; and although there are
structural differences in the nervous units or neurones, they are
all constructed on the same general architectural plan (<i>vide</i>
<a href="#image-15">fig. 15</a>). They may be divided into groups, systems, and
communities; but there are structural differences of the separate
systems, groups, and communities which may be correlated with
differences of function. The systems may be divided into: (1)
afferent sensory, including the special senses and general
<a id="page065" name="page065"><!-- pagenumber --></a>sensibility; (2) motor efferent; (3) association.</p>

<blockquote>FIG. 15.&mdash;Diagrammatic representation of a motor
neurone magnified 300 diameters. Whereas the nerve cell and its
branching processes (the dendrons) form but a minute speck of
protoplasm, the nerve fibre which arises from it, although
microscopic in diameter, extends a very long distance; in some
cases it is a yard long; consequently only a minute fraction of the
nerve fibre is represented in the diagram.</blockquote>
<p>The great brain or cerebrum consists of two halves equal in
weight, termed hemispheres, right and left; and the grey matter
covering their surface is thrown into folds with fissures between,
thus increasing enormously the superficial area of the grey matter
and of the neurones of which it consists without increasing the
size of the head. The pattern of the folds or convolutions shows a
general similarity in all human beings, certain fissures being
always present; and around these fissures which are constantly
present are situated fibre systems and communities of neurones
having particular functions (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-16">fig. 16</a>.) Thus there is a
significance in the convolutional pattern of the brain. But just as
there are no two faces alike, so there are no two brains alike in
their pattern; and just as it is rare to find the two halves of the
face quite symmetrical, so the two halves of the brain are seldom
exactly alike in their pattern. Although each hemisphere is
especially related to the opposite half of the body, the two are
unified in function by a great bridge of nerve fibres, called the
corpus callosum, which unites them. The cortical centres or
structures with specialised functions <a id="page066" name="page066"><!-- pagenumber --></a>localised in particular
regions of one hemisphere are associated by fibres passing <a id="page067" name="page067"><!-- pagenumber --></a>to the
same region in the opposite hemisphere by this bridge.</p>

<blockquote>FIG. 16.&mdash;Diagram of the left hemisphere of the
brain showing localised centres, of which the functions are known.
It will be observed that the centres for the special senses,
tactile, muscular, hearing, and vision, are all situated behind the
central fissure. The tactile-motor kin&aelig;sthetic sense occupies
the whole of the post-central convolution; the centre for hearing
(and in the left hemisphere memory of words) is shown at the end of
the first temporal convolution, but the portion shaded by no means
indicates the whole of the grey cortex which possesses this
function; a large portion of this centre cannot be seen because it
lies within the fissure forming the upper surface of the temporal
lobe. Behind this is the angular gyrus which is connected with
visual word memory. The half-vision centre, and by this is meant
the portion of brain which receives impressions from each half of
the field of vision, is situated for the most part on the inner
(unseen) surface of the occipital lobe. In front of the central
fissure is situated the motor area, or that region destruction of
which causes paralysis of the muscles moving the structures of the
opposite half of the body. If the situations indicated by black
dots be excited by an interrupted electric current, movements of
the limbs, trunk, and face occur in the precise order shown, from
the great toe to the larynx. In front of this precentral
convolution are the three frontal convolutions, and it would seem
that the functions of these convolutions are higher movements and
attention in fixation of the eyes; moreover, in the lowest frontal
region, indicated by fine dots, we have Broca's convolution, which
is associated with motor speech; above at the base of the second
middle frontal convolution is the portion of cortex in which is
localised the function of writing. Taste and smell functions reside
in brain cortex only a small portion of which can be seen, viz.
that at the tip of the temporal lobe.</blockquote>
<p>Muscles and groups of muscles on the two sides of the body which
invariably act together may thus be innervated from either
hemisphere, e.g. the muscles of the larynx, the trunk, and upper
part of the face.</p>
<p>Gall, the founder of the doctrine of Phrenology, wrecked his
fame as a scientist by associating mental faculties with conditions
of the skull instead of conditions of the brain beneath;
nevertheless, he deserves the highest credit for his discoveries
and deductions, for he was the first to point out that that part of
the brain with which psychic processes are connected must be the
cerebral hemispheres. He said, if we compare man with animals we
find that the sensory functions of animals are much finer and more
highly developed than in man; in man, on the other hand, we find
intelligence much more highly developed than in animals. Upon
comparing the corresponding anatomical conditions, we see, he said,
that in animals the deeper situated parts of the brain are
relatively more developed and the hemispheres less developed than
in man; in man, the hemispheres so surpass in development those of
animals that we <a id="page068" name="page068"><!-- pagenumber --></a>can find no analogy. Gall therefore argued that we
must consider the cerebral hemispheres to be the seat of the higher
functions of the mind. We must moreover acknowledge that the
following deductions of Gall are quite sound: "The convolutions
ought to be recognised as the parts where the instincts, feelings,
thoughts, talents, the affective qualities in general, and the
moral and intellectual forces are exercised." The Paris Academy of
Science appointed a commission of inquiry, May, 1808, which
declared the doctrine of Gall to be erroneous. Gall moreover
surmised that the faculty of language lay in the frontal lobes, and
Bouillaud supported Gall's proposition by citing cases in which
speech had been affected during life, and in which after death the
frontal lobes were found to be damaged by disease. A great
controversy ensued in France; popular imagination was stirred up
especially in the republic by the doctrine of Gall, which was an
attempt to materialise and localise psychic processes.
Unfortunately Gall's imagination, encouraged by a widespread wave
of popular sympathy, overstepped his judgment and launched him into
speculative hypotheses unsupported by facts. His doctrine of
Phrenology was shown to be absolutely illogical; <a id="page069" name="page069"><!-- pagenumber --></a>consequently it
was forgotten that he was the pioneer of cerebral localisation.</p>

<a id="RULE4_9" name="RULE4_9"><!-- RULE4 9 --></a>
<h2>SPEECH AND RIGHT-HANDEDNESS</h2>
<p>The next step in Cerebral Localisation was made by a French
physician, Marc Dax, who first observed that disease of the left
half of the cerebrum producing paralysis of the right half of the
body (right hemiplegia) was associated with loss of articulate
speech. This observation led to the establishment of a most
important fact in connection with speech, viz. that right-handed
people use their left cerebral hemisphere as the executive portion
of the brain in speech. Subsequently it was shown that when
left-handed people were paralysed on the left side by disease of
the right hemisphere, they lost their powers of speech. But the
great majority of people are born right-handed, consequently the
right hand being especially the instrument of the mind in the
majority of people, the left hemisphere is the leading hemisphere;
and since probably specialisation of function of the right hand
(dexterity) has been so closely associated with that other
instrument of the mind, the vocal instrument of articulate speech,
the two have now become inseparable; for are not graphic signs and
verbal signs intimately <a id="page070" name="page070"><!-- pagenumber --></a>interwoven in the development of language
and human intelligence?</p>
<p>What has determined the predominance of the left hemisphere in
speech? I can find no adequate anatomical explanation. There is no
difference in weight of the two hemispheres in normal brains.
Moreover, I am unable to subscribe to the opinion that there is any
evidence to show that the left hemisphere receives a larger supply
of blood than the right. Another theory advanced to explain
localisation of speech and right-handedness in the left hemisphere
is that the heavier organs, lung and liver, being on the right side
have determined a mechanical advantage which has led to
right-handedness in the great majority of people. This theory has,
however, been disposed of by the fact that cases in which there has
been a complete transposition of the viscera have not been
left-handed in a larger proportion of cases. The great majority of
people, modern and ancient, civilised and uncivilised, use the
right hand by preference. Even graphic representations on the
sun-baked clay records of Assyria, and the drawings on rocks,
tusks, and horns of animals of the flint-weapon men of prehistoric
times show that man was then right-handed. There is a difference of
opinion whether anthropoid <a id="page071" name="page071"><!-- pagenumber --></a>apes use the right hand in preference to
the left. Professor Cunningham, who made a special study of this
subject, asserts that they use either hand indifferently; so also
does the infant at first, and the idiot in a considerable number of
cases. Then why should man, even primitive, have chosen the right
hand as the instrument of the mind? Seeing that there is no
apparent anatomical reason, we may ask ourselves the question: Is
it the result of an acquired useful habit to which anatomical
conditions may subsequently have contributed as a co-efficient?
Primitive man depended largely upon gesture language, and the
placing of the hand over the heart is universally understood to
signify love and fidelity. Uneducated deaf mutes, whose only means
of communicating with their fellow-men is by gestures, not only use
this sign, but imply hatred also by holding the hand over the heart
accompanied by the sign of negation. Moreover, pointing to the
heart accompanied by a cry of pain or joy would indicate
respectively death of an enemy or friend. Again, primitive man
protected himself from the weapons of his enemies by holding the
shield in his left hand, thus covering the heart and leaving the
right hand free to wield his spear. The <a id="page072" name="page072"><!-- pagenumber --></a>question whether it would
have been to his advantage to use either hand indifferently for
spear and shield has been, to my mind, solved by the fact that in
the long procession of ages evolution has determined right-handed
specialisation as being more advantageous to the progress of
mankind than ambidexterity. Right-handedness is an inherited
character in the same sense as the potential power of speech.</p>

<h2>LOCALISATION OF SPEECH CENTRES IN THE BRAIN</h2>
<p>In 1863 Broca showed the importance in all right-handed people
(that is in about ninety-five per cent of all human beings) of the
third <i>left</i> frontal convolution for speech (<i>vide</i> figs.
<a href="#image-16">16</a> and <a href="#image-17">17</a>); when this is destroyed by disease, although the patient
can understand what is said and can understand written and printed
language, the power of articulate speech is lost. <i>Motor
Aphasia</i>. This portion of the brain is concerned with the
revival of the motor images, and has been termed by Dr. Bastian
"the glosso-kin&aelig;sthetic centre," or the cortical grey matter,
in which the images of the sense of movement of the lips and tongue
are formed (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-17">fig. 17</a>). A destruction of a similar
portion of the cortex in a right-handed person produces <a id="page073" name="page073"><!-- pagenumber --></a>no loss of
speech; but if the person is left-handed there is aphasia, because
he, being left-handed, uses the third <i>right</i> inferior frontal
convolution for speech. These facts have for long been accepted by
most neurologists, but recently doubts have been cast upon this
fundamental principle of cerebral localisation by a most
distinguished French neurologist, M. Marie; he has pointed out that
a destructive lesion of the cortex may be accompanied by
subcortical damage, which interrupts fibres coming from other parts
of the brain connected with speech.</p>
<p>In the study of speech defects it is useful to employ a diagram;
a certain part of the brain corresponds to the <i>Speech Zone</i>
there indicated, and lesions injuring any part of this area in the
left hemisphere cause speech defects (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-17">fig. 17</a>). All
neurologists, M. Marie included, admit this, and the whole question
therefore is: Is a destruction of certain limited regions of the
superficial grey matter the cause of different forms of speech
defects, or are they not due more to the destruction of subcortical
systems of fibres, which lie beneath this cortical speech zone?</p>
<p>There is a certain portion of the speech zone which is assumed
to be connected with the revival of written or printed <a id="page074" name="page074"><!-- pagenumber --></a>language,
and is called the <i>visual word-centre</i>. There is another
region connected with the memory of spoken words&mdash;the
<i>auditory word-centre</i>; you will observe that it is situated
in the posterior third of the first temporal convolution, but this
does not <a id="page075" name="page075"><!-- pagenumber --></a>comprise nearly the whole of it, for there is an extensive
surface of grey matter lying unseen within the fissure, called the
transverse convolutions, or gyri. Lesions of either of these
regions give rise to <i>Sensory Aphasia</i>, which means a loss of
speech due to inability to revive in memory the articulate sounds
which serve as verbal symbols, or the graphic signs which serve as
visual symbols for language.</p>

<b>Fig. 17</b></center>
<blockquote>FIG. 17.&mdash;Diagram to illustrate the Speech Zone of
the left hemisphere (Bastian). This scheme is used to explain the
mechanism of speech, but probably the centres are not precisely
limited, as shown in the diagram; it serves, however, to explain
disorders of speech. Destruction of the brain substance in front of
the central fissure gives rise to what is termed Motor Aphasia and
Motor Agraphia, because the patient no longer recalls the images of
the movements necessary for expressing himself in articulate speech
or by writing. Destructive lesions behind the central fissure may
damage the portion of the brain connected with the mental
perception of the sounds of articulate language, or the portion of
the brain connected with the mental perception of language in the
form of printed or written words&mdash;Sensory Aphasia; the former
entails inability to speak, the latter inability to
read.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This speech zone acts as a whole, and many disorders of
speech may arise from destructive lesions within its limits. It has
a special arterial supply, viz. the middle cerebral, which divides
into two main branches&mdash;an anterior, which supplies the motor
portion, and a posterior, which supplies the posterior sensory
portion. The anterior divides into two branches and the posterior
into three branches, consequently various limited portions of the
speech zone may be deprived of blood supply by blocking of one of
these branches. The speech zone of the left hemisphere directly
controls the centres in the medulla oblongata that preside over
articulation and phonation; innervation currents are represented by
the arrows coming from the higher to the lower
centres.</blockquote>
<p>These several cortical regions are connected by systems of
subcortical fibres to two regions in front of the ascending frontal
convolution (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-17">fig. 17</a>), called respectively the
"glosso-kin&aelig;sthetic" (sense of movement of tongue) and the
"cheiro-kin&aelig;sthetic" (sense of movement of hand) centres. Now
a person may become hemiplegic and lose his speech owing either to
the blood clotting in a diseased vessel, or to detachment of a
small clot from the heart, which, swept into the circulation, may
plug one of the arteries of the brain. The arteries branch and
supply different regions, consequently a limited portion of the
great brain may undergo destruction, giving rise to certain
localising symptoms, according to the situation of the area which
has been deprived of its blood supply. Upon the death of the
patient, a correlation <a id="page076" name="page076"><!-- pagenumber --></a>of the symptoms observed during life and the
loss of brain substance found at the <i>post-mortem</i> examination
has enabled neurologists to associate certain parts of the brain
surface with certain functions; but M. Marie very rightly says:
None of the older observations by Broca and others can be accepted
because they were not examined by methods which would reveal the
extent of the damage; the only cases which should be considered as
scientifically reliable are those in which a careful examination by
sections and microscopic investigation have determined how far
subcortical structures and systems of fibres uniting various parts
of the cortex in the speech zone have been damaged. Marie maintains
that the speech zone cannot be separated into these several
centres, and that destruction of Broca's convolution does not cause
loss of speech (<i>vide</i> figs. <a href="#image-16">16</a>, <a href="#image-17">17</a>). There are at present two
camps&mdash;those who maintain the older views of precise cortical
centres, and those who follow Marie and insist upon a revision.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer says that "our intellectual operations are
indeed mostly confined to the auditory feelings as integrated into
words and the visual feelings as integrated into ideas of objects,
their relations and their motions."</p>
<a id="page077" name="page077"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<p>Stricker by introspection and concentration of attention upon
his own speech-production came to the conclusion that the primary
revival of words was by the feeling of movements of the muscles of
articulation; but there is a fallacy here, for the more the
attention is concentrated upon any mental process the more is the
expressive side brought into prominence in consciousness. This can
be explained by the fact that there is in consequence of attention
an increased outflow of innervation currents to special lower
executive centres, thence to the muscles, but every change of
tension in the speech muscles is followed by reciprocal incoming
impressions appertaining to the sense and feeling of the movement.
The more intense the sense of movement, the greater will be the
effect upon consciousness. In fact, a person who reads and thinks
by articulating the words, does so because experience has taught
him that he can concentrate his attention more perfectly; therefore
his memory or understanding of the subject read or thought of will
be increased. Very many people think and commit to memory by this
method of concentrating attention; they probably do not belong to
the quick, perceptive, imaginative class, but rather <a id="page078" name="page078"><!-- pagenumber --></a>to those who
have power of application and who have educated their minds by
close voluntary attention. Galton found a large proportion of the
Fellows of the Royal Society were of this motor type. But the fact
that certain individuals make use of this faculty more than others
does not destroy the arguments in favour of the primary revival of
words in the great majority of persons by a subconscious process in
the auditory centre, which is followed immediately by correlated
revival of sensori-motor images. Although the sensori-motor images
of speech can be revived, it is almost impossible without moving
the hand to revive kin&aelig;sthetic impressions concerned in
writing a word. Both Ballet and Stricker admit this fact, and it
tends to prove that the sense of hearing is the primary incitation
to speech.</p>
<p>Charcot in reference to the interpretation of speech defects
divided persons into four classes&mdash;auditives, visuals, motors,
and indifferents. There are really no separate classes, but only
different kinds of word-memory in different degrees of excellence
as regards the first three; and as regards the fourth there is no
one kind of memory developed to a preponderating degree. Bastian
doubts the second class, but does <a id="page079" name="page079"><!-- pagenumber --></a>not deny that the visual type may
exist; for Galton has undoubtedly shown that visual memory and
power of recall of visual word images varies immensely in different
individuals, and it is unquestionable that certain individuals
possess the visualising faculty to an extraordinary degree; some
few, moreover, can see mentally every word that is uttered; they
give their attention to the visual symbolic equivalent and not to
the auditory. Such persons may, as Ribot supposes, habitually think
and represent objects by visual typographic images. Lord Macaulay
and Sir James Paget were notable possessors of this visualising
faculty. The former is said to have been able to read a column of
"The Times" and repeat it <i>verbatim</i>; the latter could deliver
his lectures <i>verbatim</i> as he had written them. Both saw
mentally the print or MS. in front of them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is a question of degree how much motor images
enter into silent thought and into the primary revival of words in
different individuals. Mach in "Analysis of Sensations" says: "It
is true that in my own case words (of which I think) reverberate
loudly in my ear. Moreover, I have no doubt that thoughts may be
directly excited by the ringing of <a id="page080" name="page080"><!-- pagenumber --></a>a house-bell, by the whistle of
a locomotive, etc., that small children and even dogs understand
words which they cannot repeat. Nevertheless I have been convinced
by Stricker that the ordinary and most familiar, though not the
only possible way, by which speech is comprehended is really
<i>motor</i> and that we should be badly off if we were without it.
I can cite corroborations of this view from my own experience. I
frequently see strangers who are endeavouring to follow my remarks
slightly moving their lips."</p>

<a id="RULE4_11" name="RULE4_11"><!-- RULE4 11 --></a>
<h2>THE PRIMARY SITE OF REVIVAL OF WORDS IN SILENT THOUGHT</h2>
<p>Since destructive lesions of the speech zone of the left
hemisphere in right-handed persons leads to inability to revive the
memory pictures of the sounds of words as heard in ordinary speech,
the revival of visual impressions as seen in printed or written
characters, and of the kin&aelig;sthetic (sense of movement)
impressions concerned with the alterations of the minute tensions
of the muscle structures employed in the articulation of words, it
must be presumed that the left hemisphere in right-handed persons
is dominant in speech and silent thought; it may even dominate the
use <a id="page081" name="page081"><!-- pagenumber --></a>of the left hand for many movements. But does not the right
hemisphere take a part? Yes; and I will give my reasons later for
supposing that the whole brain is in action. During the voluntary
recall of words in speech and thought by virtue of the intimate
association tracts connecting the grey matter of the whole speech
zone, it is not a single part of this zone which is in action, but
the whole of it; and when we assign to definite parts of the speech
zone different functions in connection with language, we really
refer to areas in which the process is most active or is primarily
initiated, for the whole brain is in action just as it is in the
recognition of an object which we see, hear, feel, or move. What
really comes before us is contributed more by the mind itself than
by the present object.</p>
<p>There is, however, a direct functional association between the
auditory and glosso-kin&aelig;sthetic (sense of movement of the
tongue) centres on the one hand and the visual and
cheiro-kin&aelig;sthetic (sense of movement of the hand) on the
other. No less intimate must be the connection between the auditory
word-centre and the visual word-centre; they must necessarily be
called into association actively in successive units of time, <a id="page082" name="page082"><!-- pagenumber --></a>as in
reading aloud or writing from dictation. Educated deaf mutes think
with revived visual symbols either of lips or fingers. Words are to
a great extent symbols whereby we carry on thought, and thinking
becomes more elaborate and complex as we rise in the scale of
civilisation, because more and more are verbal symbols instituted
for concrete visual images.</p>
<p>In which portion of the brain are words primarily and
principally revived during the process of thinking? I have already
alluded to the views of Stricker and those who follow him, viz.
that words are the revived images of the feelings of the sense of
movement, caused by the alteration in the tension of the muscles of
articulation occurring during speech, with or without phonation.
There is another which I think the correct view, that words are
revived in thought primarily as auditory images, so that the sense
of hearing is essential for articulation as well as phonation; the
two operations of the vocal organ as an instrument of the mind
being inseparable. The arguments in favour of this are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The part of the brain concerned with the sense of hearing
develops earlier and the nerve fibres found in this situation <a id="page083" name="page083"><!-- pagenumber --></a>are
myelinated<a href="#note-3">&sup3;</a> at an earlier period of
development of the brain than the portion connected with the sense
of movement of the muscles of articulation.</p>
<a id="note-3" name="note-3"><!-- Note Anchor 3 --></a>
<blockquote>[Footnote 3: The covering of the fibres by a sheath of
phosphoretted fat serving to insulate the conductile portion of the
nerve is an indication that the fibre has commenced to function as
a conductor of nervous impulses.]</blockquote>
<p>2. As a rule, the child's first ideas of language come through
the sense of hearing; articulate speech is next evolved, in fact
the child speaks only that which it has heard; it learns first to
repeat the names of persons and objects with which it comes into
relation, associating visual images with auditory symbols.</p>
<p>An example of this was communicated by Darwin to Romanes. One of
his children who was just beginning to speak, called a duck a
"quack." By an appreciation of the resemblance of qualities it next
extended the term "quack" to denote all birds and insects on the
one hand, and all fluid objects on the other. Lastly, by a still
more delicate appreciation of resemblance the child called all
coins "quack" because on the back of a French sou it had seen the
representation of an eagle (Romanes' "Mental Evolution in Man," p.
183). Later on, children who have been educated acquire a knowledge
of <a id="page084" name="page084"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the application of visual symbols, and how to represent them by
drawing and writing, and associate them with persons and
objects.</p>
<p>3. There is more definiteness of impression and readiness of
recall for auditory than for articulatory motor sense feelings.</p>
<p>4. After the acquirement of speech by the child, auditory
feelings are still necessary for articulate speech processes; for
if it were not so, how could we explain the fact that a child up to
the fifth or sixth year in full possession of speech will become
dumb if it loses the sense of hearing from middle-ear disease,
unless it be educated later by lip language.</p>
<p>5. Cases have been recorded of bilateral lesion of the auditory
centre of the brain producing loss of hearing and loss of speech,
the motor centres being unaffected. This is called Wernicke's
sensory aphasia. The following case occurring in my own practice is
probably the most complete instance recorded.</p>

<h2>CASE OF DEAFNESS ARISING FROM DESTRUCTION OF THE AUDITORY
CENTRES IN THE BRAIN CAUSING LOSS OF SPEECH</h2>
<p>A woman at the age of twenty suddenly became unconscious and
remained so for three hours; on recovery of consciousness <a id="page085" name="page085"><!-- pagenumber --></a>it was
found she could not speak; this condition remained for a fortnight;
speech gradually returned, although it was impaired for a month or
more. She married, but soon after marriage she suddenly lost her
hearing completely, remaining permanently stone deaf; and although
she could understand anything of a simple character when written,
and was able imperfectly to copy sentences, she was unable to
speak. Once, however, under great emotional excitement, while I was
examining her by written questions, she uttered, "Is that." But she
was never heard to speak again during the subsequent five years
that she lived. The utterance of those two words, however, showed
that the loss of speech was not due to a defect of the
physiological mechanism of the vocal instrument of speech, nor to
the motor centres in the brain that preside over its movements in
the production of articulate speech. She recognised pictures and
expressed satisfaction or dissatisfaction when correct or incorrect
names were written beneath the pictures; moreover, in many ways, by
gestures, facial expression, and curious noises of a high-pitched,
musical, whining character, showed that she was not markedly
deficient in intelligence. Although <a id="page086" name="page086"><!-- pagenumber --></a>in an asylum and partially
paralysed, she was not really insane in the proper sense, but
incapable of taking care of herself. When other patients were
getting into mischief this patient would give a warning to the
attendants by the utterance of inarticulate sounds, showing that
she was able to comprehend what was taking place around and reason
thereon, indicating thereby that although stone deaf and dumb, it
was probable that she possessed the power of silent thought. I
observed that during emotional excitement the pitch of the sounds
she uttered increased markedly with the increase of excitement.
After having been discharged from Claybury Asylum she was sent to
Colney Hatch Asylum. Upon one of my visits to that institution I
learnt that she had been admitted, and upon my entering the ward,
although more than a year had elapsed since I last saw her, she
immediately and from afar recognised me; and by facial expression,
gesture, and the utterance of inarticulate sounds showed her great
pleasure and satisfaction in seeing one who had taken a great
interest in her case. This poor woman must have felt some
satisfaction in knowing that someone had interpreted her mental
condition, <a id="page087" name="page087"><!-- pagenumber --></a>for of course, her husband and friends did not
understand why she could not speak. I may mention that the first
attack of loss of speech was attributed to hysteria.</p>
<p>This woman died of tuberculosis seven years after the second
attack, and examination of the brain <i>post-mortem</i> revealed
the cause of the deafness. There was destruction of the centre of
hearing in both hemispheres (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-17">fig. 17</a>), caused by
blocking of an artery supplying in each hemisphere that particular
region with blood. The cause of the blocking of the two arteries
was discovered, for little warty vegetations were found on the
mitral valve of the left side of the heart. I interpreted the two
attacks thus: one of these warty vegetations had become detached,
and escaping into the arterial circulation, entered the left
carotid artery and eventually stuck in the posterior branch of the
middle cerebral artery, causing a temporary loss of word memory,
consequently a disturbance of the whole speech zone of the left
hemisphere. This would account for the deafness to spoken language
and loss of speech for a fortnight, with impairment for more than a
month, following the first attack. But both ears are represented in
each half of <a id="page088" name="page088"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the brain; that is to say, sound vibrations entering
either ear, although they produce vibrations only in one auditory
nerve, nevertheless proceed subsequently to both auditory centres.
The path most open, however, for transmission is to the opposite
hemisphere; thus the right hemisphere receives most vibrations from
the left ear and <i>vice versa</i>. Consequently the auditory
centre in the right hemisphere was able very soon to take on the
function of associating verbal sounds with the sense of movement of
articulate speech and recovery took place. <i>But</i>, when by a
second attack the corresponding vessel of the opposite half of the
brain was blocked the terminal avenues, and the central stations
for the reception of the particular modes of motion associated with
sound vibration of all kinds were destroyed <i>in toto</i>; and the
patient became stone deaf. It would have been extremely interesting
to have seen whether, having lost that portion of the brain which
constitutes the primary incitation of speech, this patient could
have been taught lip language.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that persons who become deaf from destruction
of the peripheral sense organ late in life do not lose the power of
speech, and children who are <a id="page089" name="page089"><!-- pagenumber --></a>stone deaf from ear disease and dumb
in consequence can be trained to learn to speak by watching and
imitating the movements of articulation. Helen Keller indeed,
although blind, was able to learn to speak by the education of the
tactile motor sense. By placing the hand on the vocal instrument
she appreciated by the tactile motor sense the movements associated
with phonation and articulation. The tactile motor sense by
education replaced in her the auditory and visual senses. The
following physiological experiment throws light on this subject. A
dog that had been deprived of sight by removal of the eyes when it
was a puppy found its way about as well as a normal dog; but an
animal made blind by removal of the occipital lobes of the brain
was quite stupid and had great difficulty in finding its way about.
Helen Keller's brain, as shown by her accomplishments in later
life, was a remarkable one; not long after birth she became deaf
and blind, consequently there was practically only one avenue of
intelligence left open for the education of that brain, viz. the
tactile kin&aelig;sthetic. But the tactile motor sense is the
active sense that waits upon and contributes to every other sense.
The <a id="page090" name="page090"><!-- pagenumber --></a>hand is the instrument of the mind and the agent of the will;
consequently the tactile motor sense is intimately associated in
its structural representation in the brain with every other sense.
This avenue being open in Helen Keller, was used by her teacher to
the greatest possible advantage, and all the innate potentialities
of a brain naturally endowed with remarkable intellectual powers
were fully developed, and those cortical structures which normally
serve as the terminal stations (<i>vide</i> <a href="#image-16">fig. 16</a>) for the
reception and analysis of light and sound vibrations were utilised
to the full by Helen Keller by means of association tracts
connecting them with the tactile motor central stations. The brain
acts as a whole in even the simplest mental processes by virtue of
the fact that the so-called functional centres in the brain are not
isolated fields of consciousness, but are inextricably associated
one with another by association fibres.</p>

<h2>THE PRIMARY REVIVAL OF SOME SENSATIONS IN THE BRAIN</h2>
<p>I have on <a href="#page077">page 77</a> referred to Stricker's views on the primary
revival of words in the sense of movement of the lips and tongue.
Mach ("Analysis of the Sensations") <a id="page091" name="page091"><!-- pagenumber --></a>says: "The supposition that the
processes in the larynx during singing have had something to do
with the formation of the tonal series I noticed in one of my
earlier publications, but did not find it tenable. Singing is
connected in too extrinsic and accidental a manner with hearing to
bear out such an hypothesis. I can hear and imagine tones far
beyond the range of my own voice. In listening to an orchestral
performance with all the parts, or in having an hallucination of
such a performance, it is impossible for me to think that my
understanding of this broad and complicated sound-fabric has been
effected by my <i>one</i> larynx, which is, moreover, no very
practised singer. I consider the sensations which in listening to
singing are doubtless occasionally noticed in the larynx a matter
of subsidiary importance, like the pictures of the keys touched
which when I was more in practice sprang up immediately into my
imagination on hearing a performance on the piano or organ. When I
imagine music, I always distinctly hear the notes. Music can no
more come into being merely through the motor sensations
accompanying musical performances, than a deaf man can hear by
watching the movements of players. <a id="page092" name="page092"><!-- pagenumber --></a>I cannot therefore agree with
Stricker on this point" (comp. Stricker, "Du langage et de la
musique," Paris, 1885).</p>
<p>Of the motor type myself and having a fairly good untrained ear
for music, I find that to memorise a melody, whether played by an
instrument or by an orchestra, I must either try to sing or hum
that melody in order to fix it in my memory. Every time I do this,
association processes are being set up in the brain between the
auditory centres and the centres of phonation; and when I try to
revive in my silent thoughts the melody again, I do so best by
humming aloud a few bars of the melody to start the revival and
then continuing the revival by maintaining the resonator in the
position of humming the tune, viz. with closed lips, so that the
sound waves can only escape through the nose; under such
circumstances the only definite conscious muscular sensation I have
is from the effect of closure of the lips; the sensations from the
larynx are either non-existent or quite ill-defined, although I
hear mentally the tonal sensations of the melody. No doubt by
closing the lips in silent humming I am in some way concentrating
attention to the sensori-motor sphere of phonation and
articulation, <a id="page093" name="page093"><!-- pagenumber --></a>and by reactive association with the auditory sphere
reinforcing the tonal sensations in the mind. The vocal cords
(ligaments) themselves contain very few nerve fibres; those that
are seen in the deeper structures of the cords and adjacent parts
mainly proceed to the mucous glands. This fact, which I have
ascertained by numerous careful examinations, is in accordance with
the fact that there are no conscious kin&aelig;sthetic impressions
of alterations of position and tension of the vocal cords. A
comparative microscopic examination of the tip of the tongue and
the lips shows a remarkable difference, for these structures are
beset with innumerable sensory nerves, whereby every slightest
alteration of tension and minute variations in degrees of pressure
of the covering skin is associated with messages thereon to the
brain. The sense of movement in articulate speech is therefore
explained by this fact. There is every reason then to believe that
auditory tonal images are the sole primary and essential guides to
the minute alterations of tension in the muscles of the larynx
necessary for the production of corresponding vocal sounds. By
humming a tune we concentrate our attention and thereby limit the
activity of neural processes to <a id="page094" name="page094"><!-- pagenumber --></a>systems and communities of neurones
employed for the perception of tonal images and their activation in
motor processes; and this helps to fix the tune in the memory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="RULE4_14" name="RULE4_14"><!-- RULE4 14 --></a>
<h2>PSYCHIC MECHANISM OF THE VOICE</h2>
<p>A musical speaking voice denotes generally a good singing voice,
and it must be remembered that articulation cannot be separated
from phonation in the psychic mechanism. In speaking, we are
unconscious of the breath necessary for the production of the
voice. Not so, however, in effective singing, the management of the
breathing being of fundamental importance; and it is no
exaggeration to say that only the individual who knows how to
breathe knows how to sing effectually. A musical ear and sense of
rhythm are innate in some individuals; in others they are not
innate and can only be acquired to a variable degree of perfection
by persevering efforts and practice. The most intelligent persons
may never be able to sing in tune, or even time; the latter (sense
of rhythm) is much more easily acquired by practice than the former
(correct intonation). This is easily intelligible, for rhythmical
movement appertains also to speech and other acts of human beings,
e.g. walking, dancing, running, <a id="page095" name="page095"><!-- pagenumber --></a>swimming, etc.; moreover,
rhythmical periodicity characterises the beat of the heart and
respiration.</p>
<p>But how does a trained singer learn to sing a song or to take
part in an opera? He has to study the performances of two parts for
the vocal instrument&mdash;the part written by the composer and the
part written by the poet or dramatist&mdash;and in order to present
an artistic rendering, the intellectual and emotional characters of
each part must be blended in harmonious combination. A singer will
first read the words and understand their meaning, then memorise
them, so that the whole attention subsequently may be given to
applying the musical part to them and employing with proper
phrasing, which means more than knowing when to breathe; it means
imparting expression and feeling. A clever actor or orator can, if
he possess a high degree of intelligence and a fairly artistic
temperament, so modulate his voice as to convey to his audience the
passions and emotions while feeling none of them himself; so many
great singers who are possessed of a good musical ear, a good
memory, and natural intelligence, although lacking in supreme
artistic temperament and conspicuous musical ability, are
nevertheless <a id="page096" name="page096"><!-- pagenumber --></a>able to interpret by intonation and articulation the
passions and emotions which the composer has expressed in his music
and the poet or dramatist in his words. The intelligent artist
possessed of the musical ear, the sense of rhythm, and a
well-formed vocal organ accomplishes this by the conscious control
and management of his breathing muscles and the muscles of
articulation, which by education and imitation he has brought under
complete control of the will. With him visual symbols of musical
notes are associated with the visual symbols of words in the mind,
and the visual symbols whether of the words or of the musical notes
will serve to revive in memory the sound of the one or the other,
or of both. But he produces that sound by alteration of tension in
co-ordinated groups of muscles necessary for vocalisation, viz. the
muscles of phonation in the larynx, the muscles of articulation in
the tongue, lips, jaw, and palate, and the muscles of costal
respiration. <i>The mind</i> of the orator, actor, and dramatic
singer exercises a profound influence upon the respiratory system
of nerves, and thereby produces the necessary variations in the
force, continuance, and volume of air required for vocal
expression.</p>
<a id="page097" name="page097"><!-- pagenumber --></a>
<p>Sir Charles Bell, who discovered the respiratory system of
nerves, pointed out how the lungs, from being in the lower animals
merely the means of oxygenating the blood, become utilised in the
act of expelling air from the body for the production of audible
sounds&mdash;the elements of human voice and speech. Likewise he
drew attention to the influence which powerful emotions exercise
upon the organ of respiration, including the countenance, e.g. the
dilated nostrils in anger. Again, "when the voice suffers
interruption and falters, and the face, neck, and chest are
animated by strong passion working from within the breast, language
exerts its most commanding influence."</p>
<p>In hemiplegia or paralysis of one half of the body, there is a
difference between the two sides for ordinary automatic unconscious
diaphragmatic breathing and voluntary or costal breathing. Thus in
ordinary breathing the movements are increased on the paralysed
side, especially in the upper part of the chest, while in voluntary
breathing they are increased on the sound side. Hughlings Jackson
suggested the following theory to explain these facts: "<i>Ordinary
breathing</i> is an automatic act governed by the respiratory
centre in the medulla. The respiratory <a id="page098" name="page098"><!-- pagenumber --></a>centre is double, each side
being controlled or inhibited by higher centres on the opposite
side of the brain. Voluntary costal breathing, such as is employed
in singing, is of cerebral origin, and controlled by centres on the
opposite side of the brain, the impulses being sent down to the
respective centres for the associated movements of the muscles of
articulation, phonation, and breathing, in the same way as they are
sent to the centres for the movements of the arm or leg. With
voluntary breathing the respiratory centre in the medulla has
nothing to do. It is in fact out of gear or inhibited for the time
being, so that the impulses from the brain pass by or evade it.
There are thus two sets of respiratory nerve fibres passing from
the brain&mdash;the one inhibiting or controlling to the opposite
half of the respiratory centre in the medulla; the other direct,
evading the respiratory centre and running the same course to the
spinal centres for the respiratory movements as the ordinary motor
fibres do to the centres for other movements. Both sets would be
affected by the lesion (or damage) which produced the hemiplegia.
The inhibitory fibres being damaged, the opposite half of the
respiratory centre would be under diminished <a id="page099" name="page099"><!-- pagenumber --></a>control and therefore
the movements of ordinary breathing on the paralysed side would be
exaggerated. The damage to the direct fibres would prevent the
passage of voluntary stimuli to the groups of respiratory muscles
(as it would do to the rest of the muscles of the paralysed side),
and thus the voluntary movement of respiration would be
diminished&mdash;diminished only and not completely abolished as in
the limbs; because according to the theory of Broadbent, in the
case of such closely associated bilateral movements the lower
nervous respiratory centres of both sides would be activated from
either side of the brain." This certainly applies also to the
muscles of phonation, but not to the principal muscles of
articulation, viz. the tongue and lips. It is not exactly known
what part of the cerebral cortex controls the associated movements
necessary for voluntary costal (rib) respiration in singing;
probably it is localised in the frontal lobe in front of that part,
stimulation of which gives rise to trunk movements (<i>vide</i>
<a href="#image-16">fig. 16</a>). Whatever its situation, it must be connected by
association fibres with the centres of phonation and
articulation.</p>

<blockquote>FIG. 18.&mdash;The accompanying diagram is an attempt
to explain the course of innervation currents in
phonation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>1. Represents the whole brain sending voluntary
impulses <i>V</i> to the regions of the brain <a id="page100" name="page100"><!-- pagenumber --></a>presiding over the
mechanisms of voluntary breathing and phonation. These two regions
are associated in their action by fibres of association <i>A</i>;
moreover, the corresponding centres in the two halves of the brain
are unified in their action by association fibres <i>A'</i> in the
great bridge connecting the two hemispheres (Corpus Callosum). On
each side of the centre for phonation are represented association
fibres <i>H</i> which come from the centre of hearing; these fibres
convey the guiding mental images of sounds and determine exactly
the liberation of innervation currents from the centre of phonation
to the lower centres by which the required alterations in tension
of the laryngeal muscles for the production of the corresponding
sounds are effected. Arrows are represented passing from the centre
of phonation to the lower centres in the medulla which preside over
the muscles of the jaw, tongue, lips, and larynx. Arrows indicate
also the passage of innervation currents from the centres in the
brain which preside over voluntary breathing. It will be observed
that the innervation currents which proceed from the brain pass
over to the opposite side of the spinal cord and are not
represented as coming into relation with the respiratory centre
<i>R</i>. This centre, as we have seen, acts automatically, and
exercises especially its influence upon the diaphragm, which is
less under the control of the will than the elevators of the ribs
and the abdominal muscles.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The diagram also indicates why these actions of
voluntary breathing and phonation can be initiated in either
hemisphere; it is because they are always bilaterally associated in
their action; consequently both the higher centres in the brain and
the lower centres in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord are
united by bridges of association fibres, the result being that even
if there is a destruction of the brain at <i>a-b</i>, still the
mind and will can act through both centres, although not so
efficiently. Likewise, if there is a destruction of the fibres
proceeding from the brain centres to the lower medullary and spinal
centres, the will is still able to act upon the muscles of
phonation and breathing of both sides of the body because of the
intimate connection of the lower medullary and spinal centres by
association fibres.</blockquote>
<p>Experiments on animals and observations on human beings show
that the centres presiding over the muscles of the larynx are
situated one in each hemisphere, at the lower end of the ascending
frontal convolution in close association with that of the tongue,
lips, and jaw. This is as we should expect, for they form a part of
the whole cerebral mechanism which presides over the voice in
speech and song. But because the muscles of the tongue, the lower
face muscles, and even the muscles of the jaw do not necessarily
and always work synchronously <a id="page102" name="page102"><!-- pagenumber --></a>and similarly on the two sides, there
is more independence in their representation in the cerebral
cortex. Consequently a destruction of this region of the brain or
the fibres which proceed from it to the lower executive bulbar and
spinal centres is followed by paralysis of the muscles of the
opposite side. Likewise stimulation with an interrupted electric
current applied to this region of the brain in monkeys by suitable
electrodes produces <a id="page103" name="page103"><!-- pagenumber --></a>movements of the muscles of the lips, tongue,
and jaw of the opposite side only. Not so, however, stimulation of
the region which presides over the movements of the muscles of the
larynx, for then <i>both</i> vocal cords are drawn together and
made tense as in phonation. It is therefore not surprising if
removal or destruction of this portion of the brain <i>on one
side</i> does not produce paralysis of the muscles of phonation,
which, always bilaterally associated in their actions, are
represented as a bilateral group in both halves of the brain. These
centres may be regarded as a part of the physiological mechanism,
but the brain acts as a whole in the psychic mechanism of speech
and song. From these facts it appears that there is: (1) An
automatic mechanism for respiration and elemental phonation (the
cry) in the medulla oblongata which can act independently of the
higher centres in the brain and even without them (<i>vide</i> p.
18). (2) A cerebral conscious voluntary mechanism which controls
phonation either alone or associated with articulation. The opening
of the glottis by contraction of the abductor (posterior
ring-pyramid muscles) is especially associated with descent of the
diaphragm in inspiration in ordinary breathing; whereas <a id="page104" name="page104"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the
voluntary breathing in singing is associated with contraction of
the adductor and tensor muscles of the vocal cords.</p>
<p>A perfect psychic mechanism is as necessary as the physiological
mechanism for the production of perfect vocalisation, especially
for dramatic singing. A person, on the one hand, may be endowed
with a grand vocal organ, but be a failure as a singer on account
of incorrect intonation, of uncertain rhythm or imperfect diction;
on the other hand, a person only endowed with a comparatively poor
vocal instrument, but knowing how to use it to the best advantage,
is able to charm his audience; incapable of vigorous sound
production, he makes up for lack of power by correct phrasing and
emotional expression. We see then that the combination of a perfect
physiological and psychological mechanism is essential for
successful dramatic singing, the chief attributes of which are: (1)
Control of the breath, adequate volume, sustaining power, equality
in the force of expulsion of air to avoid an unpleasant vibrato,
and capability of producing and sustaining loud or soft tones
throughout the register. (2) Compass or range of voice of not less
than two octaves with adequate control by mental perception of <a id="page105" name="page105"><!-- pagenumber --></a>the
sounds of the necessary variation in tension of the laryngeal
muscles for correct intonation. (3) Rich quality or timbre, due
partly to the construction of the resonator, but in great measure
to its proper use under the control of the will. Something is
lacking in a performance, however perfect the vocalisation as
regards intonation and quality, if it fails to arouse enthusiasm or
to stir up the feelings of an audience by the expression of passion
or sentiment through the mentality of the singer.</p>
<p>The general public are becoming educated in music and are
beginning to realise that shouting two or three high-pitched chest
notes does not constitute dramatic singing&mdash;"a short <i>beau
moment</i> does not compensate for a <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i>."
It would be hard to describe or define the qualities that make a
voice appeal to the multitude. Different singers with a similar
timbre of voice and register may sing the same song correctly in
time, rhythm, and phrasing, and yet only one of them may produce
that sympathetic quality necessary to awaken not only the
intellectual but the affective side of the mind of the hearers.
Undoubtedly the effects produced upon the mind by dramatic song
largely depend upon circumstances <a id="page106" name="page106"><!-- pagenumber --></a>and surroundings, also upon the
association of ideas. Thus I was never more stirred emotionally by
the human voice than upon hearing a mad Frenchman sing at my
request the Marseillaise. Previously, when talking to him his eyes
had lacked lustre and his physiognomy was expressionless; but when
this broad-chested, six foot, burly, black-bearded maniac rolled
out in a magnificent full-chested baritone voice the song that has
stirred the emotions and passions of millions to their deepest
depth, and aroused in some hope, in others despair, as he made the
building ring with "Aux armes, citoyens, formez vos bataillons" I
felt an emotional thrill down the spine and a gulp in the throat,
while the heart and respirations for an instant stayed in their
rhythmical course. Not only was I stirred by the effect of the
sounds heard, but by the change in the personality of the singer.
It awakened in my mind the scenes in the French Revolution so
vividly described by Carlyle. The man's facial expression and whole
personality suddenly appeared changed; he planted his foot firmly
forward on the ground, striking the attitude of a man carrying a
musket, a flag, or a pike; his eyes gleamed with fire and the
lack-lustre <a id="page107" name="page107"><!-- pagenumber --></a>expression had changed to one of delirious excitement.
A pike in his hand and a red cap on his head would have completed
the picture of a <i>sans culotte</i>. Dramatic song therefore that
does not evoke an emotional response is <i>vox et pr&aelig;terea
nihil</i>.</p>

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
